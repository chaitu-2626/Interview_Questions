### ✅ Short Answer:

**Technically yes**, Node.js **could** work without V8, **but in practice, it doesn’t** (by default). Node.js is **tightly coupled** with the **V8 engine**, but it's not absolutely tied to it.

---

### 🔍 Let’s break it down:

#### ✅ What is V8?

* V8 is the **JavaScript engine** developed by Google (used in Chrome).
* It takes JS code and **compiles it to machine code**.
* Node.js uses it to **execute JavaScript outside the browser**.

---

### ✅ Can Node.js Work Without V8?

* Node.js is **built on top of V8**, but in theory:

  * You could **swap out V8** and plug in another JS engine.
  * But it would require **major effort** because Node APIs depend heavily on V8 internals.

---

### 🚧 Real-World Alternatives (Experimental):

1. **Node.js + Chakra (Microsoft's engine) → [ChakraCore Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore)**

   * A fork of Node.js that used **ChakraCore** instead of V8.
   * Microsoft built it to run JS in Edge + explore engine flexibility.
   * Now **deprecated**.

2. **Deno** (by Node.js creator, Ryan Dahl)

   * Uses **V8**, but is architected differently.
   * Deno proves that you could build a Node-like runtime using **any engine**.

3. **JXcore (supports V8 and SpiderMonkey)**

   * Experimental runtime that tried engine swapping.
   * Also **discontinued**.

### 🧠 Key Point for Interviews:

> **“Node.js is designed to work with V8, but in theory, you could replace it with another JS engine. However, this is rare and complex because much of Node's core is optimized for V8 internals like memory handling, garbage collection, and performance tuning.”**

---

### 🔧 Practical Consideration:

* 99.9% of Node.js environments today **rely on V8**.
* Replacing it would require **forking Node**, rebuilding native bindings, and re-implementing behavior that’s tightly coupled to V8.
