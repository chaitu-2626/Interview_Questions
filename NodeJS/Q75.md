### ‚úÖ What is `__filename` in Node.js?

`__filename` is a **global variable** in Node.js that gives you the **absolute path** of the **current file** being executed.

---

### üß™ Example:

```js
// demo.js
console.log(__filename);
```

When you run this:

```bash
node demo.js
```

You‚Äôll get output like:

```
/Users/yourname/projects/demo.js
```

This is the **full file path** to `demo.js`.

---

### üì¶ Use Case Scenarios

1. **Logging file location (for debugging):**

   ```js
   console.log(`[LOG] Running file: ${__filename}`);
   ```

2. **Dynamically getting directory or path info:**

   ```js
   const path = require('path');

   const currentFile = __filename;
   const currentDir = path.dirname(__filename);

   console.log(currentDir); // directory where file is located
   ```

3. **Useful in modules to load files relative to the current file:**

   ```js
   const fs = require('fs');
   const path = require('path');

   const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'data.txt'); // __dirname is sibling to __filename
   const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');
   console.log(content);
   ```

---

### ‚ùó Important Notes:

* It gives the **absolute path**, not relative.
* It works **file-wise** ‚Äî each module has its own `__filename`.
* It is not available in the browser (Node-only).

### üß† Quick Recap:

| Variable     | What it gives                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `__filename` | Absolute path of the current file |
| `__dirname`  | Directory of the current file     |
