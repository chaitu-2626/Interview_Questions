**NPM (Node Package Manager)** is used for managing **JavaScript packages** in Node.js projects. It is the default package manager for Node.js and serves two main purposes:

---

### ðŸ”§ 1. **Dependency Management**

* Installs external libraries (called packages or modules) that your application needs.
* Maintains a `package.json` file to keep track of dependencies and project metadata.
* Supports semantic versioning (e.g., `^`, `~`) to manage compatible package versions.

**Example:**

```bash
npm install express
```

This installs Express.js and adds it to your `node_modules` and `package.json`.

---

### ðŸ“¦ 2. **Package Publishing and Sharing**

* Allows you to publish your own packages/modules to the NPM registry.
* Useful for creating reusable components, internal tools, or open-source libraries.

**Example:**

```bash
npm publish
```

This publishes your package to [https://www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com).
