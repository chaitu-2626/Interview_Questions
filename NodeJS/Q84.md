## üß† What are *Hidden Classes* in V8?

**Hidden Classes** are an internal optimization used by the **V8 engine** (used in Node.js and Chrome) to **speed up property access** on JavaScript objects.

Think of them as **"blueprints"** for how objects are structured in memory.

---

## üîç Why does V8 use Hidden Classes?

In JavaScript:

* Objects are dynamic ‚Äî you can add/remove properties at runtime.
* That flexibility is great for developers, but **hard to optimize** for performance.

To fix this, V8 creates **Hidden Classes** behind the scenes to simulate a structure like you'd have in statically typed languages (C++, Java).

## üöÄ Purpose of Hidden Classes:

| Purpose                      | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Optimize property access** | Enables V8 to access object properties using fast, predictable memory lookups (like compiled languages) |
| **Avoid dictionary mode**    | Helps avoid slow hash-table-style object lookups when object shapes are consistent                      |
| **Enable inline caching**    | Improves performance by caching property access instructions                                            |

## üì¶ Example ‚Äì Hidden Class in Action

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const p1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
const p2 = new Person('Bob', 25);
```

* V8 creates a **shared hidden class** for `p1` and `p2`, since they have the same structure.
* Access to `p1.name` and `p2.name` becomes very fast ‚Äî constant time with predictable memory layout.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Tip: Avoid Hidden Class De-optimization

If you modify object structure inconsistently, V8 may create **new hidden classes**, which hurts performance.

### Bad:

```js
const obj = {};
obj.name = 'Alice';
obj.age = 30;
delete obj.age;       // ‚ö†Ô∏è Changing shape
obj.gender = 'female'; // ‚ö†Ô∏è Another shape
```

Each structural change forces V8 to make a **new hidden class**, which disables optimizations.

### Good:

```js
const obj = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
  gender: 'female'
};
```

Or assign properties in a consistent order.

## üß† TL;DR ‚Äì Why Hidden Classes Matter:

* They help V8 **optimize object property access** (faster than dynamic hash lookups).
* They're **invisible** to your code but critical to performance.
* Writing code with **consistent object shapes** helps V8 reuse hidden classes and run faster.
