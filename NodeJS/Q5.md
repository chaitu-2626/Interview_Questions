### 🚀 What is **V8**?

**V8** is **Google’s high-performance JavaScript engine**, written in C++.
It’s the engine that **runs JavaScript code** inside:

* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* **Node.js** (on the server)

---

### 🔧 What Does V8 Do?

V8 takes your **JavaScript code** and:

1. **Parses it** → Turns it into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
2. **Compiles it to machine code** using **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation
3. **Runs the optimized machine code** directly on your computer’s processor

✅ This makes JavaScript **run extremely fast** — much faster than interpreting it line by line.

---

### 🧠 Why Is V8 Important in Node.js?

When you write:

```js
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

Node.js uses V8 to **execute that JavaScript code**, just like Chrome does — but **outside the browser**, on your machine/server.

**Node.js = V8 + C++ bindings + standard libraries (fs, http, etc.)**

### 📦 V8 + Libuv = Node.js Core

* **V8** handles the **JavaScript execution**
* **Libuv** handles **async I/O, event loop, networking**, etc.

Together, they allow Node.js to be **non-blocking**, fast, and powerful.
