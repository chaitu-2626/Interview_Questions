## ✅ What is the **Event Loop** in Node.js?

> The Event Loop is a **mechanism in Node.js** that handles **asynchronous operations** (like I/O, timers, promises) by using a **single-threaded loop**.

Despite Node.js being single-threaded, the event loop allows it to handle **thousands of concurrent tasks** without blocking the main thread.

---

## 🧠 Why is it Important?

* Allows **non-blocking I/O**
* Lets Node.js serve many clients **without multi-threading**
* Powers async functions like `fs.readFile`, `setTimeout`, `HTTP`, and `Promise`

---

## 🔄 How It Works (Simple View):

1. Node starts the **call stack**
2. When it hits async code (like `setTimeout`), it:

   * Offloads it to the **Node API** (C++ binding)
   * Keeps running other code
3. When the async task finishes, its callback is pushed into a **queue**
4. The Event Loop picks the callback from the queue and runs it when the call stack is empty

---

## 📦 Example:

```js
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Promise');
});

console.log('End');
```

🟢 Output:

```
Start
End
Promise
Timeout
```

### 💡 Why?

* `Promise` goes to the **microtask queue**
* `setTimeout` goes to the **macrotask queue**
* Microtasks run **before** macrotasks in the Event Loop
