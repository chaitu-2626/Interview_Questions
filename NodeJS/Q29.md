## ✅ What is Mocha in Node.js?

**Mocha** is a **JavaScript testing framework** that runs on **Node.js** and in the browser. It's mainly used for **unit testing** and **integration testing**.

> It provides a way to **describe**, **run**, and **organize** your tests clearly and effectively.

## 🔍 What does “Node.js userland” mean?

* **Userland** refers to the **ecosystem built by users/developers** — outside of Node.js core.
* So, **Mocha is not built into Node.js** — it’s a package you install via npm.

> *"Think of Mocha as a popular tool in the community-built ecosystem (userland), not part of Node's built-in modules like `fs` or `http`."*

## 📦 Key Features of Mocha

* Supports **BDD** and **TDD** styles (describe/it vs suite/test)
* Works well with **assertion libraries** like Chai
* Easy **async testing** using callbacks, promises, or `async/await`
* Provides **hooks**: `before()`, `after()`, `beforeEach()`, `afterEach()`

## 🧪 Simple Example

```js
// test/math.test.js
const assert = require('assert');

describe('Math functions', () => {
  it('should return 4 when adding 2 + 2', () => {
    assert.strictEqual(2 + 2, 4);
  });
});
```

Run it with:

```bash
npx mocha
```
