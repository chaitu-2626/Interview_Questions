## Why use `Buffer` instead of binary strings?

### 1. **Binary strings are NOT designed for raw binary data**

* JavaScript strings are sequences of **UTF-16 characters** (text).
* They **cannot safely represent arbitrary binary data** because some byte sequences don't correspond to valid characters.
* Manipulating binary data as strings can cause **data corruption or loss**.

Example problem:

```js
const binaryString = '\xFF\xFE\xFD';  // Some bytes as a string
console.log(binaryString.length);  // May not equal number of bytes
```

---

### 2. **Buffers are specifically designed for binary data**

* `Buffer` is a **fixed-size raw memory allocation** outside the V8 heap.
* Stores bytes directly and allows **manipulating each byte safely**.
* Efficiently handles I/O, files, network data.

Example:

```js
const buf = Buffer.from([0xFF, 0xFE, 0xFD]);
console.log(buf.length); // 3 bytes, exactly what you expect
console.log(buf[0]); // 255 (0xFF)
```

---

### 3. **Performance benefits**

* Buffers work with raw bytes, so operations like slicing, copying, or concatenation are **much faster** than with strings.
* Avoid overhead of encoding/decoding text.
* Buffers operate directly on memory â€” ideal for I/O operations.

---

### 4. **Encoding & decoding support**

* Buffers can be **converted to/from strings** with specific encodings (`utf8`, `base64`, `hex`, etc.).
* This controlled encoding lets you safely handle and transform binary data.

Example:

```js
const buf = Buffer.from('hello', 'utf8');
console.log(buf.toString('hex')); // 68656c6c6f
```

---

### 5. **Node.js APIs expect Buffers**

* Core modules like `fs`, `net`, and `crypto` work with Buffers, not binary strings.
* Using Buffers ensures compatibility and correctness.

| Aspect            | Binary String                        | Buffer                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Data type         | UTF-16 encoded string (text)         | Raw binary data (byte array) |
| Correctness       | Can corrupt binary data              | Safe for any binary data     |
| Performance       | Slow and memory-heavy for binary ops | Fast and memory-efficient    |
| Encoding support  | Implicit, text-based                 | Explicit encoding/decoding   |
| Used by Node APIs | No                                   | Yes                          |

### TL;DR:

**Use `Buffer` when dealing with raw binary data to avoid data corruption and gain performance benefits â€” strings are for text, Buffers are for bytes!**
