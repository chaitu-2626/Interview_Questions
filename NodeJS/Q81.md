## üöÄ What is V8?

* **V8** is Google‚Äôs open-source **JavaScript engine**, originally built for Chrome.
* It **compiles JavaScript into optimized machine code** instead of interpreting it line-by-line.
* Node.js uses V8 to run JS on the server.

## üîç How V8 Works (Simplified)

### 1. **Parsing**

* V8 starts by **parsing your JavaScript code** into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** ‚Äî a tree representation of the code‚Äôs structure.
* It checks syntax and generates an intermediate representation.

### 2. **Ignition (Interpreter)**

* V8 first runs the code with **Ignition**, a **bytecode interpreter**.
* Bytecode is a lower-level, optimized version of your code ‚Äî faster than raw JS source, but not fully optimized yet.
* This allows quick startup and execution.

### 3. **TurboFan (Optimizing Compiler)**

* As your code runs, V8‚Äôs **TurboFan compiler** watches which functions run frequently (‚Äúhot code‚Äù).
* It compiles hot code into **highly optimized machine code** tailored to your CPU.
* This makes subsequent runs much faster.

### 4. **Garbage Collection**

* V8 includes an efficient **Garbage Collector (GC)** that automatically frees memory for objects no longer in use.
* It runs concurrently to minimize pause times, keeping your app responsive.

## Why V8 is Fast:

* **Just-in-time (JIT) compilation:** Combines fast startup (Ignition) with fast long-term execution (TurboFan).
* **Efficient memory management:** Smart garbage collector.
* **Optimization based on runtime profiling:** Adapts machine code to actual usage patterns.
* **Supports modern JS features:** ES6+ features, modules, async/await.

## Bonus: V8 and Node.js

* Node.js exposes native C++ APIs to V8 to create bindings between JavaScript and system-level calls.
* V8 runs the JS, and **libuv** handles async I/O, but V8 is the engine that executes the JS code itself.
