### 🔁 What is a Callback in Node.js?

**Short Answer:**
A **callback** is a **function passed as an argument** to another function, which gets **called after** that function completes its task — especially useful for **asynchronous operations**.

### 🧠 Think of It Like...

> “Hey function, when you're done, call **this** function!”

---

### 🧾 Simple Example:

```js
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
  callback(); // this runs after greeting
}

greet("Alice", function () {
  console.log("This is a callback function.");
});
```

🟢 Output:

```
Hello, Alice
This is a callback function.
```

### 📁 Real-World Example in Node.js (File Read)

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('data.txt', 'utf8', function(err, data) {
  if (err) return console.error(err);
  console.log("File content:", data); // Callback runs after file is read
});
```

### 💡 Why Callbacks Are Important

* Node.js is **asynchronous** and **non-blocking**
* Callbacks help you **wait for something to finish** (like file I/O or database queries) without freezing the app

### 🧠 Interview One-Liner:

> “A callback is a function passed to another function that runs after an asynchronous task finishes — it’s how Node.js handles async operations like reading files or making API calls.”

Let me know if you want to convert callback code to Promises or async/await for practice!
