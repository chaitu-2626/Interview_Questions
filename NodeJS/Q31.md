## Difference between cluster and worker_threads.

Both `cluster` and `worker_threads` are used to **run code in parallel**, but they work very differently and are used for different real-world needs.

## ‚úÖ Core Difference

| Feature        | `cluster`                             | `worker_threads`                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose        | **Scale** across multiple CPU cores   | Run **CPU-heavy tasks** in parallel         |
| Process Type   | Spawns **separate Node processes**    | Spawns **threads** in the same process      |
| Memory Sharing | ‚ùå Each has its **own memory**         | ‚úÖ **Shared memory** via `SharedArrayBuffer` |
| Use Case       | High-concurrency web servers          | Background CPU-intensive work               |
| Communication  | Via **IPC (inter-process messaging)** | Via **message passing or shared memory**    |

## üîß Real-World Example Use Cases

### üß© 1. **`cluster` ‚Äî Scaling an HTTP Server**

Suppose you have an Express API and want to handle **more requests per second** by using all CPU cores.

```js
// server.js (using cluster)
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);

  // Fork workers
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  // Each worker runs this
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end(`Handled by PID: ${process.pid}`);
  }).listen(3000);

  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}
```

‚úÖ **Best for:** Web servers that need to **scale across CPU cores** (horizontal scaling)

---

### üß† Key Point:

Each cluster worker is **a full Node.js process** ‚Äî so it can handle its own incoming connections, memory, etc.

---

### üß© 2. **`worker_threads` ‚Äî Offloading CPU-Heavy Work**

Let‚Äôs say your app needs to **hash passwords or compress files** without blocking incoming requests.

```js
// main.js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

function runWorker() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const worker = new Worker('./worker.js');
    worker.on('message', resolve);
    worker.on('error', reject);
  });
}

runWorker().then(result => {
  console.log('Worker result:', result);
});
```

```js
// worker.js
const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

// Simulate a CPU-intensive task
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) sum += i;

parentPort.postMessage(sum);
```

‚úÖ **Best for:** CPU-heavy tasks like:

* Hashing large files
* Image processing
* Data crunching

> "`cluster` is for scaling a Node.js server across multiple processes (CPUs), each handling its own requests. `worker_threads` is for running CPU-heavy tasks in parallel without blocking the main event loop ‚Äî useful for background computation."
