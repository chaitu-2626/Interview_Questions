## ✅ What is a Stream in Node.js?

> A **Stream** is an **abstract interface** in Node.js for working with **continuous data flows** — instead of loading the entire data into memory, it processes data in **chunks**.

It’s perfect for:

* Reading/writing large files
* Handling HTTP requests/responses
* Processing real-time data (like video/audio)

## 🎯 Why use Streams?

* ✅ Memory-efficient
* ✅ Faster performance
* ✅ Works well with large or infinite data sources

## 📦 Types of Streams in Node.js

Node.js provides **4 main types of streams**:

| Type          | Description                                | Example                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Readable**  | You can read data from it                  | `fs.createReadStream()`           |
| **Writable**  | You can write data to it                   | `fs.createWriteStream()`          |
| **Duplex**    | Both readable and writable                 | TCP sockets (`net.Socket`)        |
| **Transform** | Duplex stream that can **modify** the data | `zlib.createGzip()` (compression) |

### 🔧 Example: Reading a file with a stream

```js
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('large.txt', 'utf8');

readStream.on('data', chunk => {
  console.log('New chunk:', chunk);
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Finished reading');
});
```

This reads the file **piece by piece**, instead of all at once.

> “A stream in Node.js handles data in chunks instead of loading it all at once. There are four types: **Readable**, **Writable**, **Duplex**, and **Transform**, and they help process large data efficiently.”
