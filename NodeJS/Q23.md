## ❌ Reasons Not to Use Node.js

### 1. **CPU-Intensive Tasks (Heavy Computation)**

* Node.js is **single-threaded**, so it struggles with tasks like:

  * Large file compression
  * Video processing
  * Machine learning
* These can block the event loop and slow down all users.

> *“If an app has heavy CPU work, Node may freeze up or need extra tools like workers or child processes.”*

---

### 2. **Not Ideal for Simple CRUD with Low Traffic**

* If you’re building a basic app with low concurrency (e.g., a static blog backend), Node's async model adds **unnecessary complexity**.
* Frameworks like **Laravel (PHP)** or **Django (Python)** might be simpler and faster to develop with.

---

### 3. **Callback Hell (Without Modern Syntax)**

* Older Node.js code can get messy with **deeply nested callbacks**.
* Though `async/await` and Promises help, legacy projects might still suffer from this.

> *“If a team isn't disciplined about code structure, Node projects can become hard to maintain.”*

---

### 4. **Immature or Low-Quality Packages**

* npm is huge, but not all packages are stable or well-maintained.
* There's **no strict quality control**, so you may rely on libraries that break or are insecure.

> *“npm gives you everything, but also too much — you need to be careful what you depend on.”*

---

### 5. **Lack of Built-In Standard Library**

* Compared to languages like Python or Java, Node.js has a **minimal standard library**.
* You often have to install packages even for basic tasks like deep cloning or date formatting.

---

### 6. **Single Thread by Default**

* For scaling across CPU cores, you need to use tools like:

  * `cluster` module
  * `worker_threads`
* Not as straightforward as multi-threaded platforms like Java.

## 🧠 Interview One-Liner:

> "I avoid Node.js for CPU-heavy tasks or when simpler backend stacks like Django can do the job with less complexity. Also, the npm ecosystem, while powerful, can be risky if you’re not careful with package quality."
