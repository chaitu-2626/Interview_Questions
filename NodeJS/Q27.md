## ✅ **What is the relationship between Node.js and V8?**

### 🧠 Short Answer:

> **Node.js uses the V8 engine (from Google Chrome) to execute JavaScript code outside the browser.**

---

### 🔍 What is V8?

* **V8** is an open-source **JavaScript engine** developed by **Google**.
* It is written in **C++**.
* It powers **Google Chrome** and **Node.js**.
* It compiles JavaScript to **native machine code** for **fast performance**.

---

### 🔗 How Node.js Uses V8

* Node.js **embeds V8** to run JavaScript on the **server-side** (outside the browser).
* V8 handles the **execution of JavaScript**.
* Node.js adds **extra APIs** (like `fs`, `http`, `net`, `path`) on top of V8, because V8 itself only understands JavaScript — it doesn’t know how to read files, handle requests, etc.

---

### 🧠 Analogy:

> "V8 is like the engine of a car (it runs JavaScript), and Node.js is the car itself — with wheels, controls, and tools to drive (APIs to build servers, work with files, etc)."

---

### 📌 Real-World Example:

When you write this in Node.js:

```js
console.log("Hello from Node.js");
```

* The `console.log()` is powered by Node.js.
* The string processing and JS execution is handled by **V8**.
* Node.js uses **libuv** for async I/O, **V8** for JS execution, and **C++ bindings** for system-level access.

### 🧠 Interview One-Liner:

> “Node.js uses the V8 engine to run JavaScript on the server. V8 executes the JS, and Node.js adds libraries and APIs to let JS interact with files, networks, and the OS.”
