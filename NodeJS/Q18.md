### ✅ Difference Between **Local** and **Global** npm Package Installation

| **Aspect**       | **Local Installation**                                                       | **Global Installation**                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Location**     | Installed in the `node_modules` folder of the project                        | Installed in a global folder (system-wide or user-wide)    |
| **Usage**        | Available only within the **current project**                                | Available globally across **all projects**                 |
| **Command**      | `npm install <package-name>`                                                 | `npm install -g <package-name>`                            |
| **Example**      | Dependencies like `express` or `lodash` in a project                         | CLI tools like `webpack`, `nodemon`, `typescript`          |
| **package.json** | Automatically added to `dependencies` or `devDependencies` in `package.json` | Not added to `package.json` unless specified with `--save` |
| **Scope**        | Only accessible in the current project directory                             | Accessible from anywhere in your terminal/CLI              |

### 🔁 **Local Installation Example**

```bash
npm install express
```

* `express` is installed inside your project’s `node_modules` folder.
* Only the project you installed it in can use `express`.

### 🔁 **Global Installation Example**

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

* `nodemon` is installed globally.
* You can run `nodemon` from anywhere in your terminal, even in a different project.

### 🧠 **Key Points for Interview**:

* **Local install**: Best for **project-specific dependencies**. It gets added to `node_modules` and `package.json`.
* **Global install**: Best for **CLI tools or utilities** that are used across multiple projects (e.g., `webpack`, `typescript`).

### 🎯 Interview One-Liner:

> "Local npm packages are installed inside your project’s `node_modules` for project-specific use, while global packages are installed system-wide and can be used across different projects or directly from the terminal."
