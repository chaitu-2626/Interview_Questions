## âœ… Concurrency in Node.js

### Key Concept:

Node.js is **single-threaded** for JavaScript execution but it handles concurrency through its **non-blocking, event-driven architecture**. It doesn't run multiple threads for parallel execution by default (unless using `worker_threads` or `child_process`).

---

### ðŸš€ **How Concurrency Works in Node.js**

#### 1. **Event Loop and Non-blocking I/O**

* **Single-threaded execution** means Node runs **one operation at a time**.

* However, it uses the **event loop** and **non-blocking I/O operations** to **handle multiple tasks concurrently**.

* When a task (like a database query or file read) is encountered, Node doesnâ€™t wait for it to complete. Instead:

  * It **delegates** the task to the system (using asynchronous APIs).
  * **Moves to the next task** in the event loop while waiting for the response.

#### 2. **Callback Queue / Task Queue**

* Once an I/O operation completes (e.g., file read), it gets added to the **callback queue**.
* The event loop picks up tasks from the callback queue when the call stack is empty.

### ðŸ”§ Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

console.log('Start');

fs.readFile('large-file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File content:', data);
});

console.log('End');
```

### ðŸŸ¢ Output:

```
Start
End
File content: <contents of large-file.txt>
```

#### How it Works:

1. **Start** is logged first (synchronous code).
2. The **`fs.readFile()`** call is **non-blocking**: Node doesn't wait for the file to be read.
3. Node continues to execute the remaining code (logs **End**).
4. Once the file reading is done, the callback is added to the callback queue.
5. The event loop picks up the callback and logs the file content.

### ðŸš¨ **Concurrency vs Parallelism** in Node.js

* **Concurrency** refers to **handling multiple tasks at the same time** (interleaving execution, non-blocking).

  * **Node.js** achieves concurrency through the event loop and asynchronous I/O.
* **Parallelism** refers to **executing multiple tasks simultaneously** (multiple threads).

  * **Node.js** is **single-threaded**, but you can use tools like `worker_threads` or `child_process` for parallelism when needed.

---

### ðŸ§  Key Points:

* **Event loop** and **non-blocking I/O** allow **Node.js to handle concurrency** efficiently.
* While Node.js itself is **single-threaded**, it achieves **concurrency** (not parallelism) via **async operations** and the **event loop**.
* Node.js uses **callback queues** and **task queues** to manage asynchronous operations.
