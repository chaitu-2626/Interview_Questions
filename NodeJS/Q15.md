### ✅ **Why We Usually `require` at the Top of a File**

1. **Clarity:**
   It's a convention — putting all imports at the top makes it easy to see what dependencies the file uses.

2. **Performance:**
   Modules are loaded **once** and **cached** by Node.js. So requiring them at the top avoids doing it multiple times unnecessarily.

3. **Avoid Side Effects:**
   If a module has side effects (like setting global state), requiring it conditionally or repeatedly might lead to **unpredictable behavior**.

### ❓ Can You `require()` Inside a Function?

✅ **Yes, technically you can.** It's valid JavaScript.

### 🔁 Example:

```js
function loadModuleDynamically() {
  const fs = require('fs'); // Works just fine
  fs.readFileSync('data.txt', 'utf8');
}
```

🟡 **When is this useful?**

* Dynamic or conditional loading (e.g., load something only if needed)
* Lazy-loading large modules to improve initial startup time
* Loading environment-specific code (e.g., only in development)

### ⚠️ But Be Careful:

* **Bad for readability:** Hard to trace what dependencies a file uses.
* **Could hurt performance:** If placed in loops or repeatedly called, even though Node caches requires, it’s still messy and less efficient.
* **Not a good practice** unless you have a specific reason.
