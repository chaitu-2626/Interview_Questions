## âœ… What does the `@` prefix mean on an npm package?

The `@` prefix in an npm package name indicates one of two things:

---

### 1. **Scoped Packages** (most common)

> `@scope/package-name` refers to a **scoped package**, usually published by a specific organization or user.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

```bash
npm install @nestjs/core
```

* `@nestjs` is the **scope**
* `core` is the **package name**
* Together: this package is part of the `nestjs` scope

Scopes are used to:

* Organize packages (especially in monorepos)
* Avoid name collisions
* Set access permissions (public/private)

You might see them for:

* Frameworks: `@nestjs/core`, `@angular/core`
* Companies: `@mycompany/utils`, `@openai/api`

---

### 2. **Version Tag** (less common, but also valid)

You might also see:

```bash
npm install express@4.18.2
```

Here, `@` means **install this specific version** â€” not a scope.

## ðŸ§  Interview One-Liner:

> "The `@` in an npm package usually denotes a **scoped package**, which helps group packages under a namespace like an organization or team. It can also specify a **version** when used like `package@version`."
