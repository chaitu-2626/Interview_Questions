Running a Node.js app as a **background service** means keeping it running even after you close the terminal or the server reboots â€” ideal for production use.

There are a few popular ways to do this. Here's a breakdown of the most reliable methods:

---

## âœ… **1. Using PM2 (Recommended)**

### ğŸ”§ Steps:

1. **Install PM2 globally**

   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. **Start your app**

   ```bash
   pm2 start app.js
   ```

3. **Save the process list**

   ```bash
   pm2 save
   ```

4. **Enable startup on system boot**

   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   ```

   It will print a command. Copy and run it (it sets up the system service).

### âœ… Benefits of PM2:

* Runs app in background
* Automatically restarts on crash
* Starts app on system reboot
* Built-in logging and monitoring

---

## âœ… **2. Using `nohup` (Quick and Simple)**

```bash
nohup node app.js > output.log 2>&1 &
```

* `nohup`: prevents app from being killed after terminal is closed
* `> output.log`: sends stdout to a file
* `2>&1`: merges stderr with stdout
* `&`: runs it in the background

ğŸ§¼ To stop it:

* Use `ps aux | grep node` to find the PID
* Kill with `kill <PID>`

âœ… Good for quick tasks, but **not recommended for production**

---

## âœ… **3. Using Systemd (for Linux servers)**

For deeper integration with the OS (like running a service):

1. Create a service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
```

2. Add this content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Node.js App
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /path/to/app.js
Restart=always
User=your-username
Environment=PORT=3000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Run commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl enable myapp
sudo systemctl start myapp
```

âœ… Great for server environments, but more complex than PM2.
