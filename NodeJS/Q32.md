## ✅ How to Use Global Variables in Node.js

Node.js provides a built-in object called `global` (similar to `window` in the browser).

### 📌 Defining a global variable:

```js
global.myGlobalValue = 'Hello from global!';
```

### 📌 Accessing it elsewhere:

```js
console.log(global.myGlobalValue); // Hello from global!
```

This works across all files **within the same Node.js process**.

## 🧠 Why Would You Use Global Variables?

They might be useful when:

* You need to **share a constant value** (like an app version or config flag) across multiple modules.
* You're building **small scripts** where modularity isn't a concern.
* You want to attach utility functions or debug tools globally during development.

## ❌ Are Global Variables Always Bad?

Not always, but they are **usually discouraged**. Here's why:

| ⚠️ Problem                | 📌 Why It’s Bad                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Hard to track             | You don't know where it was set or changed.      |
| Risk of naming collisions | Different modules might overwrite the same name. |
| Breaks modularity         | Makes code harder to maintain/test.              |
| Makes debugging harder    | Unexpected side effects from shared state.       |

## ✅ Better Alternatives:

Instead of using `global`, you can:

1. Use **modules** to export shared data:

```js
// config.js
module.exports = {
  appName: 'MyApp'
};

// app.js
const config = require('./config');
console.log(config.appName);
```

2. Use **dependency injection** to pass values where needed.

3. Use a **singleton pattern** if you really need a shared state across modules.

> “You can use `global` in Node.js to define variables accessible everywhere, but it’s generally discouraged. It breaks modularity and makes code harder to debug. It's better to use modules or pass dependencies explicitly.”
