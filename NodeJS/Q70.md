Gracefully shutting down a Node.js server is essential for ensuring that ongoing requests are completed, resources are cleaned up properly, and the process exits without abrupt errors. This is especially important in production environments where downtime should be minimized.

Here’s how you can do it in a **clean** and **graceful** manner:

---

### 🧩 **Steps for Graceful Shutdown**

1. **Listen for termination signals**:

   * Use signals like `SIGINT` (Ctrl + C) and `SIGTERM` (typically for Docker or process managers like PM2) to trigger a shutdown process.

2. **Stop accepting new requests**:

   * Once the shutdown process begins, prevent the server from accepting new incoming requests.

3. **Wait for ongoing requests to finish**:

   * Allow the server to finish processing any ongoing requests before shutting down.

4. **Close open resources**:

   * Close database connections, file handles, or any other resources that might cause issues if left open.

5. **Exit the process**:

   * Once everything is closed and completed, exit the process using `process.exit()`.

### 🚀 **Example of Graceful Shutdown in Node.js (HTTP Server)**

```js
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

// Handle graceful shutdown
const shutdown = () => {
  console.log('Shutting down server...');

  // Stop accepting new requests
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('Closed all open connections.');

    // Perform any other cleanup tasks (e.g., closing DB connections)
    // Then exit the process
    process.exit(0);
  });

  // If a connection is not closed within 10 seconds, forcefully shut it down
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.error('Forcefully shutting down server.');
    process.exit(1);
  }, 10000);
};

// Handle termination signals
process.on('SIGINT', shutdown); // Ctrl + C
process.on('SIGTERM', shutdown); // Docker / PM2 shutdown
```

### 🧠 **How it Works**:

1. **`server.close()`**: This stops the server from accepting new connections, but it allows the ongoing connections to finish. This is the key to gracefully handling in-flight requests.

2. **Timeout**: If a connection is still open after 10 seconds, we forcefully exit with `process.exit(1)`. This ensures the server doesn’t hang forever in case of long-running requests.

3. **Signal Handlers (`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`)**: When the process receives either signal, the server initiates the `shutdown` function.

---

### 🔑 **Best Practices**:

* Always use `server.close()` to ensure the server stops accepting new requests but allows ongoing ones to complete.
* Implement a timeout for graceful shutdown to avoid the app hanging forever in case of stuck requests.
* Close connections to databases, queues, and other services that need to be properly released.
* When using **PM2** or similar process managers, ensure that they are set to restart your app automatically after shutdown.

### 🛠️ **Bonus: Handling Graceful Shutdown with Express**

For an **Express** app, the approach is very similar:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

const server = app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

// Graceful shutdown
const shutdown = () => {
  console.log('Shutting down Express server...');
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('Closed all open connections.');
    process.exit(0);
  });

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.error('Forcefully shutting down server.');
    process.exit(1);
  }, 10000);
};

process.on('SIGINT', shutdown);
process.on('SIGTERM', shutdown);
```

---

### 📚 **Summary**:

* Use `server.close()` to stop accepting new requests while allowing in-flight ones to finish.
* Handle `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` for graceful shutdown in production.
* Use timeouts to ensure your process doesn’t hang indefinitely.
