## üöÄ What is the `cluster` module in Node.js?

The `cluster` module lets you create **child processes (workers)** that run simultaneously and share the **same server port**. Since Node.js runs single-threaded, `cluster` helps you **utilize multiple CPU cores** by forking multiple worker processes.

---

### How `cluster` works:

* The **master process** spawns multiple **worker processes** (usually equal to CPU cores).
* Each worker runs its own Node.js instance.
* Incoming connections are distributed across workers by the OS or Node's internal scheduling.
* Workers share the same server port.
* If a worker crashes, the master can restart it to keep the app running.

---

### Basic Example:

```js
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);

  // Fork workers
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  // Restart dead workers
  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died. Starting a new one.`);
    cluster.fork();
  });
} else {
  // Workers share the TCP connection
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(`Hello from worker ${process.pid}\n`);
  }).listen(8000);

  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Difference between Cluster and Load Balancer

| Feature              | Node.js `cluster` Module                               | Load Balancer                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**            | Runs multiple worker processes on a **single machine** | Distributes traffic across **multiple machines** or instances |
| **Purpose**          | Utilize all CPU cores of one machine                   | Scale horizontally (multi-server setup)                       |
| **Traffic routing**  | Internal to Node.js, workers share the same port       | External; routes traffic at network level (DNS, IP, etc.)     |
| **Fault tolerance**  | Restarts workers on crash                              | Can route traffic away from failing servers                   |
| **Setup complexity** | Simple, built-in Node.js module                        | Requires external software (NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ELB, etc.)    |
| **Use case**         | Improve concurrency on a single server                 | Scale out to handle massive traffic with multiple servers     |

## üß† Summary

* **Cluster module** is for **multi-core scaling on a single server**.
* **Load balancers** distribute traffic across **multiple servers** or clusters.
* Both can be used together: cluster for multi-core scaling on each server, load balancer to distribute traffic across servers.
