## âœ… What is Blocking Code in Node.js?

> **Blocking code** is code that **stops the execution** of the program until the operation completes.

In other words, the **event loop waits** for the task to finish before moving on to the next one. This can **freeze the server**, especially if the operation takes a long time (e.g., reading a huge file or doing a CPU-heavy task).

### ðŸ“¦ Example of Blocking Code

```js
const fs = require('fs');

const data = fs.readFileSync('largefile.txt'); // â›” Blocking
console.log('File read complete');
```

* `fs.readFileSync()` blocks the event loop.
* While the file is being read, **nothing else can happen** â€” not even handling other incoming HTTP requests.

---

### âœ… Example of Non-Blocking Code

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('largefile.txt', (err, data) => {
  console.log('File read complete');
});
console.log('This runs immediately'); // âœ… Non-blocking
```

Here, `fs.readFile` is asynchronous and allows the event loop to keep working on other things while the file is being read.

## ðŸ§  Why Blocking is Bad in Node.js

Node.js runs on a **single thread**, so:

* If one request runs blocking code, it can **pause the entire server**.
* This is why Node is best for I/O-heavy tasks, not CPU-heavy tasks (like image processing or big calculations).

> "Blocking code in Node.js halts the event loop and prevents other operations from running. It's usually caused by synchronous methods like `fs.readFileSync()` and should be avoided in scalable applications."
