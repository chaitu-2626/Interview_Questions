In **Node.js cluster mode**, each worker runs in its own separate process, meaning they have **isolated memory** and cannot directly access each otherâ€™s variables. However, sometimes you might need to have **one shared global variable** across all clustered workers (e.g., a counter or shared configuration).

Here are some strategies to share global state between clustered workers:

---

### âœ… **1. Using `cluster` module and `IPC` (Inter-Process Communication)**

You can use **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** to communicate between workers and share data. When a worker is created, it can **send/receive messages** to/from the master process. This allows the master process to hold the shared global state.

#### Example:

1. **Master Process** (which holds the global variable)
2. **Worker Processes** (each worker can send/receive updates to/from the master)

### Example of Using `IPC` in Node.js Cluster:

```js
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

// Global state in the master process
let globalCounter = 0;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;

  console.log(`Master PID: ${process.pid}`);

  // Fork workers
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  // Handle messages from workers
  cluster.on('message', (worker, message, handle) => {
    if (message.type === 'updateCounter') {
      globalCounter += message.increment;
      console.log(`Global counter updated: ${globalCounter}`);
    }
  });

  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  });
} else {
  // Worker processes handle requests
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // Send a message to master to update the global counter
    if (req.url === '/increment') {
      process.send({ type: 'updateCounter', increment: 1 });
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
      res.end(`Counter updated by Worker ${process.pid}`);
    } else {
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
      res.end('Welcome to the Node.js Cluster Example!');
    }
  }).listen(8000);

  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}
```

### How It Works:

1. **Master Process** holds the global state (`globalCounter`) and is responsible for handling **incoming messages** from workers.
2. Workers can send a message to the master to **update the shared state** (e.g., the `globalCounter`).
3. The master process updates the counter and can send back responses to workers if necessary.

#### Key Points:

* **Master process**: Holds the global state and manages workers.
* **Worker processes**: Communicate via `process.send()` to the master to update the global state.
* **IPC** allows you to share data safely between worker processes.

### âœ… **2. Using `SharedArrayBuffer` for Shared Memory (Experimental)**

Another way to share data across workers is by using **`SharedArrayBuffer`**. This provides a way for multiple threads (or workers) to **share memory**, which can be helpful for fast, low-level synchronization.

However, this is an **experimental feature** in Node.js and should be used cautiously.

#### Example using `SharedArrayBuffer`:

```js
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const os = require('os');

// Shared memory (using SharedArrayBuffer)
const sharedMemory = new SharedArrayBuffer(Int32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT);
const sharedCounter = new Int32Array(sharedMemory);

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;
  
  console.log(`Master PID: ${process.pid}`);
  
  // Fork workers
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  });

} else {
  // Worker processes handle requests
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    if (req.url === '/increment') {
      // Atomically increment the counter (using Atomics for thread-safe increment)
      Atomics.add(sharedCounter, 0, 1); // Increment the first element (counter)
      
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
      res.end(`Counter: ${sharedCounter[0]} - Updated by Worker ${process.pid}`);
    } else {
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
      res.end('Welcome to the Node.js Shared Memory Example!');
    }
  }).listen(8000);

  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}
```

### How It Works:

* The `SharedArrayBuffer` allows you to share **memory** between workers.
* `Atomics.add()` is used for **atomic operations** to safely modify the shared counter without race conditions.
* In this setup, the **workers can read and update** the shared counter directly.

#### Key Points:

* **Shared memory** allows workers to access the same data without IPC.
* **Atomic operations** ensure the integrity of the shared state across multiple threads.

---

### ðŸ§  **Summary:**

* **IPC (`process.send`)**: The most common and recommended approach in Node.js clusters for sharing data. It involves the **master process** holding the global state and workers sending messages to the master to update it.
* **`SharedArrayBuffer`**: An experimental feature for sharing memory between workers without needing IPC, but requires careful handling of atomic operations for thread safety.
