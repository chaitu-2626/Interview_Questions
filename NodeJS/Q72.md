### ✅ What is an LTS Release of Node.js?

**LTS** stands for **Long-Term Support**.
In Node.js, LTS releases are **stable versions** that are **actively maintained** for a longer period (typically **30 months**).

### 🔁 Node.js Release Cycle (in simple terms):

* Every **October**, a new major version is released.
* It first enters **Current** status.
* After **6 months**, it becomes **LTS** (if it meets stability criteria).
* Then it's maintained under LTS for:

  * **18 months of Active LTS** (bug fixes, security updates)
  * **12 months of Maintenance LTS** (only critical fixes, security)

---

### 📌 Why Should You Care About LTS?

1. **Stability for Production:**

   * LTS versions are tested, reliable, and meant for **production apps**.
   * You avoid experimental or breaking features.

2. **Security Updates:**

   * Actively patched for security vulnerabilities.

3. **Ecosystem Support:**

   * Most popular libraries (Express, Sequelize, etc.) support LTS first.

4. **Cloud & Hosting Services:**

   * Platforms like AWS, Heroku, and Azure recommend or even **default to LTS**.

### 🔧 Practical Example:

If you're deploying an app:

```bash
# Always install the latest LTS version
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

Let’s say you’re using Node **v20.x** — that might be a Current version. But **v18.x** could be the latest LTS, which is safer for production.

---

### 🚫 Don't use non-LTS unless:

* You're testing new features.
* You're contributing to Node.js itself.
* You're building experimental side-projects.

---

### 🧠 Quick Revision Points:

* LTS = Long-Term Support = Safe for production.
* 18 months Active + 12 months Maintenance.
* Avoid "Current" unless you know what you're doing.
* Use `nvm` or `n` to manage versions.
