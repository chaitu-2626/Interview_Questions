## ✅ When Should You Use **Node.js**?

Use **Node.js** when you need:

---

### 1. ⚡ **Real-Time Applications**

* Chat apps, live notifications, collaborative tools (like Google Docs)
* Node’s **event-driven, non-blocking** nature is ideal here

✅ Example: WhatsApp Web, Slack, Socket.io-based chat apps

---

### 2. 🔁 **I/O-Heavy Applications (Not CPU-Heavy)**

* Apps that do lots of disk or network access: file streaming, APIs, DB calls
* Node handles **thousands of I/O operations efficiently**

✅ Example: File upload/download server, API Gateway

---

### 3. 🌐 **REST APIs & Microservices**

* Node’s lightweight runtime and fast startup make it perfect for microservices and REST APIs

✅ Example: Backend for single-page applications (React/Vue/Angular)

---

### 4. 🔀 **Streaming Data**

* Node’s **Stream API** is great for working with large files or media

✅ Example: Video streaming platforms, real-time log processors

---

### 5. 📲 **Single Language Stack (JavaScript Everywhere)**

* Use JS on frontend + backend = shared codebase, faster dev cycle

✅ Example: Full-stack apps using React + Express + MongoDB (MERN stack)

---

### 6. 🛠️ **Prototyping & Fast Development**

* Node’s huge npm ecosystem speeds up development

✅ Example: MVPs, proof-of-concept projects

---

## 🚫 When NOT to Use Node.js

Avoid Node.js when:

* Your app is **CPU-intensive** (e.g. image processing, machine learning)
* You need **strong type safety** at the language level (consider Go, Rust, etc.)
