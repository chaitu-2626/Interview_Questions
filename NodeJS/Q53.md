In Node.js, handling **unhandled exceptions** is critical for ensuring your application is stable and resilient. Unhandled exceptions can cause your application to crash unexpectedly, which is why itâ€™s essential to handle them properly.

### âœ… Preferred Methods for Handling Unhandled Exceptions

#### 1. **Using `process.on('uncaughtException')`**

This is a global handler for uncaught exceptions that aren't caught by try/catch blocks. However, **it's not recommended** for critical errors in production as it doesn't allow Node.js to recover gracefully.

**Note:** You should **not** use this as a catch-all solution in production. Instead, focus on catching exceptions in the code and properly handling them.

### Example:

```js
process.on('uncaughtException', (err, origin) => {
  console.error(`Unhandled exception: ${err.message}`);
  console.error(`Exception origin: ${origin}`);
  process.exit(1);  // Exit the process after logging the error
});
```

This catches uncaught exceptions and allows you to log or perform cleanup before the application exits. But **remember** that continuing to run the application after an uncaught exception is **not safe** in most cases.

#### 2. **Using `process.on('unhandledRejection')` for Unhandled Promises**

Starting from Node.js v6, **unhandled promise rejections** are handled through the `unhandledRejection` event. From Node.js v15, the default behavior is to terminate the process with a non-zero exit code when an unhandled rejection occurs. However, you can customize this behavior.

### Example:

```js
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  console.error(`Unhandled rejection at: ${promise}, reason: ${reason}`);
  process.exit(1);  // Exit the process after logging the error
});
```

This helps catch unhandled promise rejections and log them, helping with debugging.

#### 3. **Gracefully Handling Errors with Try/Catch and Async/Await**

Instead of relying solely on the global handlers, the best practice is to **use try/catch blocks** for synchronous code and **`async/await`** with **proper error handling** for asynchronous code.

### Example:

```js
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const result = await someAsyncFunction();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Caught error: ${err.message}`);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

For **synchronous errors**, always wrap potentially error-prone code in `try/catch` blocks.

#### 4. **Gracefully Restarting the Application**

For **critical errors** or unhandled exceptions that canâ€™t be recovered from, it's a good practice to **restart the application**. Using tools like **PM2** or **forever** can help ensure that your app is automatically restarted when an exception occurs, reducing downtime.

**Example:**

```bash
pm2 start app.js --watch
```

### ðŸ§  Key Points:

1. **Handle errors explicitly** using `try/catch` (for sync code) or `async/await` (for async code).
2. Use **`process.on('uncaughtException')`** for logging uncaught exceptions, but **donâ€™t rely on it** to recover from critical errors.
3. Use **`process.on('unhandledRejection')`** to handle unhandled promise rejections and prevent crashes.
4. **Gracefully restart** your app with tools like **PM2** in production.
