## ✅ What is `pm2 save`?

> `pm2 save` **saves the current process list** (apps you're running with PM2) to a **startup configuration file**.

---

### 🔍 Why use it?

By default, if your server **reboots** or **PM2 restarts**, all running apps are **lost** unless you've saved them.

`pm2 save` ensures:

* Your current running apps are saved to disk (`~/.pm2/dump.pm2`)
* PM2 can **restore them automatically** on reboot with `pm2 startup`

---

### 🔧 Typical Flow (for production):

```bash
pm2 start app.js -i max     # Start your app(s)
pm2 save                    # Save the current process list
pm2 startup                 # Generate startup script (auto-start on boot)
```

That’s it! Now if the server restarts, your app will start automatically.
