## ‚úÖ Node.js Exit Codes

Node.js uses exit codes to indicate the status of a process upon termination. These codes are particularly useful for debugging, automation, and CI/CD pipelines.

### Common Exit Codes

| Exit Code | Description                                                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`       | **Success** ‚Äì Normal termination without errors.                                        |
| `1`       | **Uncaught Fatal Exception** ‚Äì An uncaught exception occurred.                          |
| `2`       | **Reserved** ‚Äì Reserved by Bash for misuse of built-in features.                        |
| `3`       | **Internal JavaScript Parse Error** ‚Äì Rare, occurs during Node.js bootstrapping.        |
| `4`       | **Internal JavaScript Evaluation Failure** ‚Äì Rare, occurs during Node.js bootstrapping. |
| `5`       | **Fatal Error** ‚Äì Unrecoverable error in V8 engine.                                     |
| `6`       | **Non-function Internal Exception Handler** ‚Äì Internal handler is not a function.       |
| `7`       | **Internal Exception Handler Run-Time Failure** ‚Äì Internal handler threw an error.      |
| `8`       | **Reserved** ‚Äì Previously used for uncaught errors; now reserved.                       |
| `9`       | **Invalid Argument** ‚Äì Invalid argument passed to Node.js.                              |
| `10`      | **Internal JavaScript Run-Time Failure** ‚Äì Error during bootstrapping.                  |
| `12`      | **Invalid Debug Argument** ‚Äì Invalid debug argument passed.                             |
| `>128`    | **Signal Exits** ‚Äì Terminated by a fatal signal (`128 + signal code`).                  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Official Documentation

For detailed information on `process.exit()` and exit codes, refer to the official Node.js documentation:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practices

* **Avoid using `process.exit()` directly**: It's recommended to let Node.js exit naturally when the event loop is empty. For non-critical errors, use `process.exitCode` to set the exit code, allowing for graceful shutdowns.

* **Handle errors properly**: Instead of forcing an exit, catch exceptions and handle them appropriately to maintain application stability.
