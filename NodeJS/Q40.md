## ✅ Node.js `cluster` vs **PM2** Clustering

| Feature           | **Node.js `cluster`**                     | **PM2** Clustering                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔧 Type           | Native module                             | Third-party process manager                      |
| 🚀 Setup          | Manual — you write code to manage workers | Automatic — zero config needed                   |
| ⚙️ Features       | Basic process forking                     | Load balancing, logs, monitoring, restarts, etc. |
| 📉 Crash Recovery | Manual                                    | Auto-restarts crashed processes                  |
| 📊 Monitoring     | Not included                              | Built-in dashboards, metrics, and logs           |
| ♻️ Hot Reloading  | You build it                              | Built-in (`pm2 reload`)                          |
| ⏱️ Production Use | Good for full control                     | Preferred for hassle-free scaling & maintenance  |

## 🔧 Node.js `cluster` Module

Use when:

* You need **fine-grained control** over clustering
* You're building a **custom load balancer or worker system**
* You want **minimal dependencies**

Example:

```js
const cluster = require('cluster');
const os = require('os');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  const numCPUs = os.cpus().length;
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  // Your server logic here
}
```

## 🚀 PM2 Clustering

Use when:

* You want a **plug-and-play** solution
* You're deploying to **production**
* You want **monitoring, logging, process management** out of the box

Example (1 line):

```bash
pm2 start app.js -i max
```

This will:

* Auto-fork workers for all CPU cores
* Monitor and restart on crashes
* Manage logs, load balancing, and more

> “Use Node.js `cluster` for low-level control, but in production, **PM2 is the better choice** — it provides clustering, auto-restarts, monitoring, and load balancing with almost no setup.”
