## ✅ Is there a difference between `res.send()` and `return res.send()`?

### ✔️ Functionally:

> **No difference** in what gets sent to the client — in both cases, the response is sent.

### ⚠️ But: The `return` statement affects **control flow** in your route handler.

---

### 🔍 Without `return`:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  if (!req.query.user) {
    res.send('User is required');
  }

  // ⚠️ This will still run even after res.send()
  doSomething(); 
});
```

If `user` is not provided:

* `res.send('User is required')` is called ✅
* But then `doSomething()` runs ❌ (even though the response was already sent)

This may cause errors like:

```
Error: Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client
```

---

### ✅ With `return res.send()`:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  if (!req.query.user) {
    return res.send('User is required'); // ✅ stops execution here
  }

  doSomething(); // ✅ only runs if user is present
});
```

Here, `return` ensures:

* Response is sent
* Function execution stops
* No accidental double response

> "`res.send()` sends a response, but adding `return` ensures that the function stops executing. This avoids unintended behavior or errors like sending multiple responses."
