Yes, **Node.js does support multi-core platforms**, but not **natively in a single process** â€” it is **single-threaded** by default due to its event loop architecture.

However, Node.js **can fully utilize all CPU cores** using tools and modules like:

---

### âœ… 1. **Node.js `cluster` module**

* Allows you to **fork the main process** into **multiple child worker processes**, each running on a different CPU core.
* All workers share the same server port and handle requests independently.
* **Each worker has its own event loop and memory**.

#### Example:

```js
const cluster = require('cluster');
const os = require('os');
const http = require('http');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  const numCores = os.cpus().length;

  console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);
  // Fork workers
  for (let i = 0; i < numCores; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  });
} else {
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end(`Handled by worker ${process.pid}`);
  }).listen(3000);

  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}
```

* This spins up a process per core and allows **parallel processing**.

---

### âœ… 2. **PM2 (Production Process Manager)**

PM2 makes it easy to run Node.js apps in cluster mode:

```bash
pm2 start app.js -i max
```

* `-i max` means **spawn as many processes as there are CPU cores**.
* PM2 handles load balancing and process monitoring.

### ðŸ§  Summary

| Feature        | Node.js Default | With Cluster/PM2          |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| CPU Core Usage | 1 core          | All cores (multi-process) |
| Threading      | Single-threaded | Multi-process             |
| Load Balancing | Manual          | Built-in with cluster/PM2 |
| Scalability    | Limited         | High                      |

### ðŸ“Œ Final Note:

* Node.js is designed for **I/O-bound**, not **CPU-bound**, tasks.
* For heavy computation, you can offload to **worker threads** or external services.
