### ✅ When to use `require()` vs `import()` in Node.js

> I use **`require()`** in CommonJS projects, especially when I need **synchronous** loading or I’m working in a **legacy Node.js app**. It can be used dynamically, but it's still **blocking**.

> I use **`import()`** when I’m working in an **ES Module (ESM) project**, or when I need **asynchronous/dynamic loading** — like lazy-loading modules based on conditions. It's also **browser-compatible**, which makes it ideal for modern full-stack and frontend sharing.

### 🔁 Quick Rule of Thumb:

* ✅ Use `require()` → for **simple, CommonJS**, synchronous use
* ✅ Use `import()` → for **modern, async, ESM**, or browser-based code

## Things import supports
    - Static analysis - which means you code will be analysis before running which will help to catch error earlier
    - Supports tree shaking (unused code is eliminated)
    - Import is asynchronous which means the other part of the code in the application can keep running.
