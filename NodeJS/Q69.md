### 🧪 **What is Piping in Node.js?**

**Piping** in Node.js refers to **connecting the output of one stream directly into the input of another stream**.

It allows **data to flow automatically** from a readable stream to a writable stream, without manually handling events like `data` and `end`.

---

### 🧠 **Why use piping?**

* It simplifies working with streams.
* It handles **data flow, backpressure, and cleanup** internally.
* Great for working with **files**, **network requests**, **compression**, etc.

---

### 🔧 **Real-World Example: Copying a file using `pipe()`**

```js
const fs = require('fs');

// Create a readable stream from source
const readable = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');

// Create a writable stream to destination
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

// Pipe the read stream into the write stream
readable.pipe(writable);
```

✔ This copies `input.txt` to `output.txt` efficiently — even large files — without loading the entire content into memory.

---

### ⚙️ **Use Cases:**

* File copying
* Streaming video/audio
* Compression (`zlib.createGzip().pipe(...)`)
* HTTP request/response streaming

### 🔗 Bonus: Chaining Pipes (Stream Chaining)

```js
const zlib = require('zlib');

fs.createReadStream('input.txt')
  .pipe(zlib.createGzip())          // compress
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('input.txt.gz')); // save compressed file
```
