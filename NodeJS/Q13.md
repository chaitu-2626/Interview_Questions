### 😫 What is Callback Hell?

**Callback Hell** refers to a situation in asynchronous JavaScript (especially in Node.js) where multiple nested callbacks become difficult to read and maintain. It looks like a pyramid or “right-angled arrow” ⟶ making the code messy and error-prone.

---

### 🧾 Example of Callback Hell:

```js
getUser(id, (err, user) => {
  getPosts(user.id, (err, posts) => {
    getComments(posts[0].id, (err, comments) => {
      console.log(comments);
    });
  });
});
```

📉 **Problems:**

* Hard to read and debug
* Difficult to handle errors properly
* Maintenance nightmare as app grows

### ❓ Main Cause of Callback Hell

> Using **many nested asynchronous functions with callbacks** — especially when each one depends on the result of the previous one.

### ✅ Solutions

| Solution         | How it helps                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Promises**     | Flatten the structure, improve readability    |
| **Async/Await**  | Makes async code look like synchronous code   |
| **Modular Code** | Break callbacks into separate named functions |

---

### ✨ Cleaner Version with Async/Await:

```js
async function fetchData() {
  const user = await getUser(id);
  const posts = await getPosts(user.id);
  const comments = await getComments(posts[0].id);
  console.log(comments);
}
```

### 🧠 Interview Line:

> “Callback hell happens when you nest too many asynchronous operations using callbacks. It makes code hard to read and manage. The best way to fix it is by using Promises or async/await.”
