## ✅ Types of Operators in MySQL & When to Use Them

| Operator Type     | Operators                              | Purpose & When to Use                                           |                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Arithmetic**    | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`                | Use to perform math operations like addition, subtraction, etc. |                                              |
| **Comparison**    | `=`, `!=` / `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | Use to compare values (e.g., in `WHERE` clause conditions)      |                                              |
| **Logical**       | `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`                     | Use to combine multiple conditions (filtering rows)             |                                              |
| **Bitwise**       | `&`, \`                                | `, `^`, `\~`, `<<`, `>>\`                                       | Use for bit-level operations on integer data |
| **String**        | `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE`                     | Use to search for patterns with wildcards                       |                                              |
| **Set**           | `IN`, `NOT IN`                         | Use to check if a value matches any value in a list             |                                              |
| **Null Handling** | `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`               | Use to check for presence or absence of `NULL` values           |                                              |
| **Between**       | `BETWEEN ... AND ...`                  | Use to check if a value lies within a range                     |                                              |
| **Assignment**    | `:=`                                   | Use to assign values in expressions or variables                |                                              |

## 🛠️ Practical Examples of Each Operator

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**

```sql
SELECT salary, salary * 0.10 AS bonus FROM employees;
-- Calculate 10% bonus
```

---

### 2. **Comparison Operators**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary >= 50000;
-- Filter employees with salary 50k or more
```

---

### 3. **Logical Operators**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 101 AND salary > 60000;
-- Employees in department 101 with salary > 60k
```

---

### 4. **Bitwise Operators**

```sql
SELECT id, flags & 1 AS is_active FROM users;
-- Check if first bit flag is set (e.g., active status)
```

---

### 5. **String Operators (`LIKE`)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
-- Find customers whose names start with 'J'
```

---

### 6. **Set Operators (`IN`)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing');
-- Orders with status pending or processing
```

---

### 7. **Null Handling**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
-- Find employees without a manager
```

---

### 8. **Between**

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 100 AND 500;
-- Products priced between 100 and 500
```

---

### 9. **Assignment**

```sql
SET @total = (SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees);
-- Assign total salary sum to a variable
```
