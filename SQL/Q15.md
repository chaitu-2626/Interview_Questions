### ‚úÖ **Difference Between `INNER JOIN`, `OUTER JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` in SQL**

These types of joins define **how data from two tables is combined** based on a related column (usually a foreign key).

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **INNER JOIN**

* Returns **only the matching rows** from both tables.
* Rows with **no match in either table** are excluded.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID;
```

‚úÖ **Use when** you want only rows with matching data in both tables.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **LEFT OUTER JOIN (LEFT JOIN)**

* Returns **all rows from the left table**.
* If there‚Äôs **no match in the right table**, NULLs are returned for right table‚Äôs columns.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID;
```

‚úÖ **Use when** you want **all employees**, even if they‚Äôre not assigned to any department.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **RIGHT OUTER JOIN (RIGHT JOIN)**

* Returns **all rows from the right table**.
* If there‚Äôs **no match in the left table**, NULLs are returned for left table‚Äôs columns.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID;
```

‚úÖ **Use when** you want **all departments**, even those with **no employees**.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**

* Returns **all rows from both tables**.
* Matches where possible, otherwise fills with NULLs for missing values.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN Departments d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID;
```

‚úÖ **Use when** you want **all records from both tables**, matched where possible.

| Join Type         | Includes Matching Rows | Includes Unmatched Rows from Left | Includes Unmatched Rows from Right |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `INNER JOIN`      | ‚úÖ Yes                  | ‚ùå No                              | ‚ùå No                               |
| `LEFT JOIN`       | ‚úÖ Yes                  | ‚úÖ Yes                             | ‚ùå No                               |
| `RIGHT JOIN`      | ‚úÖ Yes                  | ‚ùå No                              | ‚úÖ Yes                              |
| `FULL OUTER JOIN` | ‚úÖ Yes                  | ‚úÖ Yes                             | ‚úÖ Yes                              |

### ‚úÖ **Real-Life Analogy:**

* **INNER JOIN**: People who are both on the **guest list and RSVP'd**.
* **LEFT JOIN**: Everyone on the **guest list**, whether they RSVP'd or not.
* **RIGHT JOIN**: Everyone who **RSVP'd**, even if not on the original guest list.
* **FULL OUTER JOIN**: A list showing **everyone**, whether on the guest list or RSVP'd ‚Äî match them if you can.
