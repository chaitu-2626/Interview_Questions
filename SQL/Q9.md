### ✅ **Difference Between `JOIN` and `UNION` in SQL**

Both `JOIN` and `UNION` are used to **combine data from multiple tables or queries**, but they do it in **very different ways**.

---

| Feature          | `JOIN`                                       | `UNION`                                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**      | Combines columns from two or more tables     | Combines rows from two or more queries                                     |
| **How it works** | Matches rows based on a related column (key) | Stacks result sets vertically                                              |
| **Result shape** | Wider table (more columns)                   | Taller table (more rows)                                                   |
| **Types**        | INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN | UNION (removes duplicates), UNION ALL                                      |
| **Duplicates**   | Can have duplicates unless filtered          | `UNION` removes duplicates; `UNION ALL` keeps all                          |
| **Requirement**  | Tables must be related by columns            | Queries must have the **same number of columns and compatible data types** |
| **Use case**     | Retrieve related data from multiple tables   | Combine similar data from different tables or queries                      |

### ✅ **Examples:**

**JOIN Example:**

```sql
-- Get employee names with their department names
SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.DeptID;
```

* Combines columns from `Employees` and `Departments` where `DeptID` matches.

---

**UNION Example:**

```sql
-- Get all customer emails and supplier emails in one list
SELECT Email FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT Email FROM Suppliers;
```

* Combines rows from two separate queries into one list of emails (removes duplicates).

### ✅ **Real-Life Analogy:**

* `JOIN` is like **matching people with their addresses** based on an ID card.
* `UNION` is like **combining two guest lists** into one big list.
