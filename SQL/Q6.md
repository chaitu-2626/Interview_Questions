### ✅ **What is a FOREIGN KEY in SQL?**

A **FOREIGN KEY** is a column (or set of columns) in one table that **establishes a relationship** between data in **two tables**. It ensures that the value in the foreign key column **matches a value in the primary key (or unique key)** of another table.

---

### ✅ **Key Characteristics:**

* Enforces **referential integrity**.
* Connects two tables like a **parent-child** relationship.
* Prevents actions that would **break links** between related tables.
* Can **restrict, cascade, or nullify** actions on `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.

---

### ✅ **Example:**

Suppose you have two tables: `Departments` and `Employees`

```sql
-- Parent table
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeptName VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Child table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmpName VARCHAR(100),
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
);
```

Here:

* `Departments.DeptID` is the **primary key** (unique).
* `Employees.DeptID` is the **foreign key** that refers to it.

✅ This ensures that an employee must belong to a **valid department**.

---

### ✅ **Real-Life Analogy:**

Think of a **FOREIGN KEY like a passport number on a visa**:

* The **visa (child table)** refers to a **passport (parent table)**.
* A visa is **not valid** if it refers to a **non-existent passport**.

---

### ✅ **Foreign Key Actions:**

You can control what happens on **DELETE** or **UPDATE** in the parent table:

```sql
FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
ON DELETE CASCADE       -- deletes related employees if a department is deleted
ON UPDATE CASCADE       -- updates foreign key if DeptID changes
```

Other options: `RESTRICT`, `SET NULL`, `NO ACTION`.

---

### ✅ **When to Use FOREIGN KEY:**

* To maintain **data consistency** across related tables.
* To **prevent orphaned records**.
* To model **one-to-many** or **many-to-many** relationships.
