### ✅ **What is a Primary Key?**

A **Primary Key** is a **column or a set of columns** in a table that **uniquely identifies each row** in that table.

---

### ✅ **Key Points:**

* **Unique:** No two rows can have the same value in the primary key column(s).
* **Not NULL:** A primary key column **cannot contain NULL values**.
* Each table can have **only one primary key**.
* Often used to create **relationships** between tables (as a foreign key in another table).

---

### ✅ **Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

Here, `EmployeeID` is the **primary key**—each employee must have a **unique ID**, and it **cannot be NULL**.

---

### ✅ **Real-World Analogy:**

Think of a **primary key like an Aadhar Number or Passport Number**—each person has a **unique identifier**. In a table, that’s what the primary key does—it ensures no two people (or records) are the same.

---

### ✅ **Multi-Column (Composite) Primary Key Example:**

If no single column is unique, you can use a combination:

```sql
CREATE TABLE CourseRegistrations (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID)
);
```

This ensures **a student can't register for the same course more than once**, but can register for multiple different courses.
