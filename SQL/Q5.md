### ✅ **Difference Between `TRUNCATE` and `DELETE` in SQL**

Both `TRUNCATE` and `DELETE` are used to **remove data from a table**, but they differ significantly in **performance**, **rollback behavior**, and **how they work internally**.

---

| Feature                    | `DELETE`                              | `TRUNCATE`                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                | Deletes **specific rows** or all rows | Deletes **all rows** from a table     |
| **WHERE clause**           | ✅ Yes (can filter rows)               | ❌ No (removes all rows)               |
| **Logging**                | Fully logged (row-by-row)             | Minimal logging (faster)              |
| **Rollback (Transaction)** | ✅ Can be rolled back                  | ✅ Can be rolled back (in most RDBMSs) |
| **Triggers**               | ✅ Fires `AFTER DELETE` triggers       | ❌ Does not fire triggers              |
| **Resets Identity**        | ❌ No (by default)                     | ✅ Yes (identity column is reset)      |
| **Performance**            | Slower for large tables (row by row)  | Faster (deallocates pages)            |
| **Locks**                  | Row-level or table-level              | Schema-level (heavier lock)           |

### ✅ **Example of DELETE:**

```sql
-- Deletes only employees in HR
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'HR';
```

---

### ✅ **Example of TRUNCATE:**

```sql
-- Deletes all rows from Employees
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
```

---

### ✅ **Real-Life Analogy:**

* **DELETE** is like erasing specific lines in a notebook—you pick what to remove.
* **TRUNCATE** is like tearing out the entire notebook—all pages are gone instantly.

---

### ✅ **When to Use:**

* Use **`DELETE`** when:

  * You need to **remove specific rows**.
  * You want to **fire triggers**.
  * You need **fine-grained control**.

* Use **`TRUNCATE`** when:

  * You want to **quickly remove all rows**.
  * You **don’t need triggers**.
  * You want to **reset identity columns**.
