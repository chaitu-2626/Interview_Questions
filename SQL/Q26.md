## ✅ What Is a Subquery?

A **subquery** (or inner query) is a query **nested inside another query**. It provides results that the outer/main query uses to further filter or compute.

## 🔍 Why Use a Subquery?

| Reason                                    | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 **Reusability of logic**               | Helps reuse results of one query inside another                        |
| 🎯 **Filtering based on dynamic results** | Enables filtering with values that depend on other queries             |
| 📊 **Aggregation with filters**           | Allows filtering by aggregated values (`MAX()`, `AVG()`, etc.)         |
| 🔗 **Dependency on multiple tables**      | When the outer query and filter criteria come from different tables    |
| 📦 **Encapsulation of complex logic**     | Cleanly isolate logic into small units for readability and maintenance |

## 🛠️ When to Use Subqueries

| Use Case                                     | Example Scenario                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Filter based on an aggregated result         | Find employees with salary > average salary                 |
| Filter based on values in another table      | Customers who placed at least one order                     |
| Avoid multiple joins for clarity             | When multiple joins would make the query messy or redundant |
| Use in `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` commands | Insert or update data based on another table’s values       |

## 🧪 Examples of Subqueries

### ✅ 1. **Filter Based on Aggregate**

Find employees earning more than the average salary:

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees
);
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Subquery in `FROM` (Inline View)**

Show department-wise highest salaries:

```sql
SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM (
    SELECT department_id, salary FROM employees
) AS dept_salaries
GROUP BY department_id;
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Subquery in `SELECT`**

Show each employee with their department name (alternative to JOIN):

```sql
SELECT name,
       (SELECT department_name FROM departments WHERE id = e.department_id) AS dept_name
FROM employees e;
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Subquery in `EXISTS`**

Find departments that have employees:

```sql
SELECT department_name
FROM departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM employees e WHERE e.department_id = d.id
);
```

## 🧠 When NOT to Use Subqueries

| Situation                     | Better Alternative                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Performance-sensitive queries | Use `JOIN` instead                   |
| Large data sets with `IN`     | Replace with `EXISTS` or `JOIN`      |
| Readability is affected       | Split into temporary tables or views |

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* Use **subqueries** for **modular, reusable logic**
* Perfect for **comparisons**, **filters**, and **aggregation**
* Replace with `JOIN` or `CTEs` when performance or readability matters
* Often used in `WHERE`, `SELECT`, `FROM`, `HAVING`, and `EXISTS`
