### ✅ **How to Use a VIEW to Provide a Security Layer for Your App**

A **VIEW** can act as a **security layer** by controlling and restricting what data users or applications can see or access without giving them direct access to the underlying tables.

---

### ✅ **Why Use Views for Security?**

* **Restrict columns:** Show only specific columns (hide sensitive info like passwords, salaries).
* **Filter rows:** Show only certain rows (e.g., data belonging to a specific department or user).
* **Simplify permissions:** Grant users access to the view instead of the base tables.
* **Prevent direct modification:** Views can be read-only, preventing unwanted changes.

---

### ✅ **Example Scenario:**

You have a table `Employees` with sensitive info:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    SSN VARCHAR(11)  -- sensitive data
);
```

---

### ✅ **Create a View to Hide Sensitive Data:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeePublicInfo AS
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Department
FROM Employees;
```

* This view **excludes** Salary and SSN.
* You can now **grant SELECT permission** only on the view, not on the original table.

---

### ✅ **Grant Permissions:**

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON EmployeePublicInfo TO app_user;
DENY SELECT ON Employees TO app_user;
```

* `app_user` can only see data via the view, **not the full table**.

---

### ✅ **Filtering Rows with Views:**

You can filter rows based on user or role:

```sql
CREATE VIEW DeptEmployees AS
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = USER(); -- pseudo-code, depends on DBMS
```

This shows employees only for the user's department.

---

### ✅ **Real-Life Analogy:**

Views act like a **privacy screen** — users see only what you want them to see, keeping sensitive info hidden.

---

### ✅ **Summary:**

| Security Benefit               | How VIEW Helps                    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Hide sensitive columns         | Select only non-sensitive columns |
| Restrict access to rows        | Filter rows inside the view       |
| Simplify user permissions      | Grant access to view, not tables  |
| Protect data from modification | Make view read-only               |
