## ‚úÖ What Are Wildcard Characters?

Wildcard characters are special symbols used to **match patterns in strings**, typically used with the `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` operators in SQL.

## üß© Common Wildcard Characters in MySQL

| Wildcard | Description                                                                        | When to Use It                                      | Example                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `%`      | Matches **zero or more characters**                                                | When you're unsure how many characters may be there | `'A%'` ‚Üí matches "Anna", "Alex", "A" |
| `_`      | Matches **exactly one character**                                                  | When you want a specific length pattern             | `'J_n'` ‚Üí matches "Jon", "Jan"       |
| `[]`     | Matches **any single character** in a set (not supported in MySQL `LIKE`)          | Not used in MySQL with `LIKE` ‚Äî use regex           |                                      |
| `[^]`    | Matches **any single character not in a set** (also not supported in MySQL `LIKE`) | Use in regex only                                   |                                      |
| `ESCAPE` | Defines an **escape character** to treat `%` or `_` as literals                    | When you want to search for `%` or `_` literally    | `'50\%%' ESCAPE '\'` ‚Üí matches "50%" |

### üìå Note:

* MySQL supports `%` and `_` with `LIKE`.
* For more complex patterns, use `REGEXP` (Regular Expressions).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Examples

### 1. **Match any name starting with 'A'**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

üü¢ Matches: `Alice`, `Adam`, `Annie`

---

### 2. **Match any name with 3 characters, starting with 'J' and ending with 'n'**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'J_n';
```

üü¢ Matches: `Jan`, `Jon`, `Jim` ‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt match: `John`, `Joon`

---

### 3. **Match all emails ending with `@gmail.com`**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';
```

---

### 4. **Search for product codes containing an underscore (\_) as a literal**

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE code LIKE '%\_%' ESCAPE '\';
```

‚úÖ Here, `_` is escaped so it's treated as a normal character, not a wildcard.

## üß† When to Use Wildcards

| Scenario                                                            | Wildcard(s) to Use   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Search for names that start/end with text                           | `%`                  |
| Match patterns with specific character length                       | `_`                  |
| Look for records containing certain text                            | `%pattern%`          |
| Escape `%` or `_` to search them literally                          | `ESCAPE` with `LIKE` |
| Need advanced matching (e.g., begins with a vowel, ends with digit) | Use `REGEXP` instead |

## üîë Key Takeaways

* Use `%` for **multi-character** wildcard.
* Use `_` for **single-character** wildcard.
* Use `ESCAPE` when searching for literal `%` or `_`.
* For complex patterns (like character ranges), consider `REGEXP`.
