## ‚úÖ Common Aggregate Functions in MySQL & When to Use Them

| Function         | Description                              | When to Use                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COUNT()`        | Counts the number of rows                | To find how many records match a condition                              |
| `SUM()`          | Calculates the total sum                 | To get total sales, total salary, etc.                                  |
| `AVG()`          | Calculates the average value             | To find average marks, salary, etc.                                     |
| `MIN()`          | Finds the smallest value                 | To get the minimum salary, lowest price, earliest date, etc.            |
| `MAX()`          | Finds the largest value                  | To get the highest salary, max age, latest date, etc.                   |
| `GROUP_CONCAT()` | Combines multiple values into one string | To combine row values into a comma-separated string (e.g., tags, names) |

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Examples for Each Function

### 1. **`COUNT()`**

üìå *Use to count rows or records*

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_users FROM users;
```

With `WHERE`:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed';
```

---

### 2. **`SUM()`**

üìå *Use to get the total of a numeric column*

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees;
```

With `GROUP BY`:

```sql
SELECT department, SUM(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```

---

### 3. **`AVG()`**

üìå *Use to calculate average*

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees;
```

---

### 4. **`MIN()`**

üìå *Use to get the smallest value*

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) AS min_salary FROM employees;
```

---

### 5. **`MAX()`**

üìå *Use to get the largest value*

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM employees;
```

---

### 6. **`GROUP_CONCAT()`**

üìå *Use to combine multiple values from rows into a single string*

```sql
SELECT department, GROUP_CONCAT(name) AS employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

üìù Output Example:

```
Sales     | John, Alice, Emma
IT        | Mike, Jane
```

---

## üîÑ Combined Example

```sql
SELECT department,
       COUNT(*) AS emp_count,
       AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
       MAX(salary) AS max_salary,
       GROUP_CONCAT(name) AS employee_names
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
