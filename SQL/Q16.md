### ‚úÖ **Which is Faster: One Big Query or Many Small Queries?**

**Short Answer:**

> In most cases, **one well-optimized big query** is faster and more efficient than multiple small queries.

### ‚úÖ **Why One Big Query is Usually Better:**

| Benefit                      | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fewer Round Trips**        | Sending many small queries increases communication between the app and the DB (network overhead). |
| **Better Query Planning**    | A single query allows the database to optimize execution across the whole operation.              |
| **Atomicity**                | One big query can run as a **single transaction**, ensuring consistency.                          |
| **Reduced Locking/Blocking** | Small queries might lock rows/tables repeatedly, increasing contention.                           |

### ‚úÖ **Example:**

#### üü• Many Small Queries:

```sql
SELECT Salary FROM Employees WHERE EmpID = 1;
SELECT Salary FROM Employees WHERE EmpID = 2;
SELECT Salary FROM Employees WHERE EmpID = 3;
-- And so on...
```

#### ‚úÖ One Big Query:

```sql
SELECT EmpID, Salary 
FROM Employees 
WHERE EmpID IN (1, 2, 3);
```

‚úîÔ∏è The second approach is **faster, scalable, and easier to maintain**.

### ‚úÖ **When Small Queries Might Be Useful:**

| Situation                       | Reason                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Different data sources**      | If each query hits different systems or APIs.        |
| **Async parallel execution**    | When executed in parallel in a distributed system.   |
| **Avoiding memory overload**    | When fetching large datasets in chunks (pagination). |
| **Fine-grained error handling** | Easier to retry just one part if it fails.           |

### ‚úÖ **Best Practice:**

* Prefer **one big query**, **but keep it readable and optimized**.
* Use **`JOINs`**, **`IN`**, **`UNION ALL`**, or **subqueries** to merge logic.
* For large inserts/updates, use **batch processing** with a single transaction.

### ‚úÖ Real-Life Analogy:

* **One big query** is like ordering **everything in one shopping trip**.
* **Many small queries** is like making **multiple trips for each item** ‚Äî more time, more effort, more traffic.
