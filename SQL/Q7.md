### ✅ **Difference Between `WHERE` and `HAVING` Clause in SQL**

Both `WHERE` and `HAVING` are used to **filter records**, but they are used at **different stages** of query execution and for **different purposes**.

### ✅ **Quick Comparison:**

| Feature                 | `WHERE`                    | `HAVING`                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Used with**           | Raw rows (before grouping) | Grouped data (after `GROUP BY`)       |
| **Filters on**          | Columns                    | Aggregates (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, etc.) |
| **Query Stage**         | Acts **before** grouping   | Acts **after** grouping               |
| **Can use aggregates?** | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                                 |
| **Performance**         | Faster (filters early)     | Slightly slower (filters after group) |

### ✅ **Example with `WHERE`:**

```sql
-- Get employees in IT department
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

Here, `WHERE` filters **individual rows**.

---

### ✅ **Example with `HAVING`:**

```sql
-- Get departments with more than 5 employees
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

Here:

* `GROUP BY` groups the rows by department.
* `HAVING` filters **groups**, not individual rows.

---

### ✅ **Combined Example:**

```sql
-- Get departments (not HR) where employee count > 3
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS Total
FROM Employees
WHERE Department != 'HR'
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

### ✅ **Real-Life Analogy:**

* `WHERE` is like filtering ingredients **before cooking**.
* `HAVING` is like tasting the dish **after it's cooked** and deciding whether to serve it.
