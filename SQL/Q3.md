### ✅ **What is a VIEW in SQL?**

A **VIEW** is a **virtual table** based on the result of a **SQL query**. It does **not store data physically**, but displays data from one or more underlying tables.

---

### ✅ **Key Characteristics:**

* Acts like a table but **does not hold data itself**.
* Simplifies complex queries by **encapsulating logic**.
* Can be used to **restrict access** to certain columns or rows.
* Automatically reflects **data changes** in the underlying tables.

---

### ✅ **Syntax:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

---

### ✅ **Example:**

Suppose you have a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

Now, create a view to show only employees from the "IT" department:

```sql
CREATE VIEW IT_Employees AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

Then you can use it like a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM IT_Employees;
```

### ✅ **Types of Views:**

| Type               | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple View**    | Based on a single table, no functions or joins.         |
| **Complex View**   | Involves multiple tables, joins, or aggregations.       |
| **Updatable View** | Can update base table through it (with conditions).     |
| **Read-only View** | Cannot be updated (e.g., if it uses joins, aggregates). |

---

### ✅ **Real-Life Analogy:**

Think of a VIEW like a **filtered lens or a saved report** in Excel. You don’t copy the full dataset—you just create a **window to see only what you need**.

---

### ✅ **When to Use Views:**

* To **simplify** complex queries for developers/users.
* To **restrict access** to sensitive data (e.g., show only certain columns).
* To **standardize** commonly used queries or logic.
