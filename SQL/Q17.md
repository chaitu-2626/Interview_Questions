### ‚úÖ **Difference Among `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS` in SQL**

These three set operations are used to **combine and compare results from two `SELECT` queries**, but each behaves differently:

---

| Set Operation | Description                                                          | Keeps Duplicates? | Supported In                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **UNION**     | Combines all **unique** rows from both queries                       | ‚ùå No              | SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.   |
| **UNION ALL** | Combines **all rows**, including duplicates                          | ‚úÖ Yes             | SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.   |
| **INTERSECT** | Returns only **common rows** present in **both queries**             | ‚ùå No              | Oracle, PostgreSQL, (not in MySQL)     |
| **MINUS**     | Returns rows from the **first query** that are **not** in the second | ‚ùå No              | Oracle only (SQL Server uses `EXCEPT`) |

---

### ‚úÖ **Visual Representation:**

```
Query1:   A B C
Query2:   B C D

UNION      ‚Üí A B C D
INTERSECT  ‚Üí B C
MINUS      ‚Üí A   (A is in Query1 but not in Query2)
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Examples**

#### üîπ `UNION`

```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers;
```

‚úîÔ∏è Combines cities from both tables, removes duplicates.

---

#### üîπ `INTERSECT`

```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers
INTERSECT
SELECT City FROM Suppliers;
```

‚úîÔ∏è Shows cities that exist in **both** tables.

---

#### üîπ `MINUS` (Oracle) or `EXCEPT` (SQL Server)

```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers
MINUS
SELECT City FROM Suppliers;
```

‚úîÔ∏è Shows cities in `Customers` but **not** in `Suppliers`.

---

### ‚úÖ **Important Notes:**

* All set operations require:

  * **Same number of columns** in both queries.
  * **Compatible data types** in corresponding columns.
* `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS` **remove duplicates** by default.
* Use `UNION ALL` for performance if duplicates are acceptable.

### ‚úÖ **Real-Life Analogy:**

* **UNION**: Merge two contact lists and remove duplicates.
* **INTERSECT**: Find common friends between two people.
* **MINUS**: Find friends in your list but not in someone else‚Äôs.
