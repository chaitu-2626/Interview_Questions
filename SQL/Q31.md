## ✅ What is an Alias in SQL?

An **alias** is a temporary name **assigned to a column or table** in a SQL query using the `AS` keyword (or without it). It **doesn’t change the actual table or column name** — it's just used for that specific query result.

## 🔍 When to Use an Alias?

| Use Case                          | Why Use Alias                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Readability**                 | Simplifies long or complex expressions                      |
| ✅ **Rename columns in output**    | Makes output user-friendly (e.g., in reports or dashboards) |
| ✅ **Join queries**                | Makes table references shorter and clearer                  |
| ✅ **Nested queries (subqueries)** | Required when subqueries are used as virtual tables         |
| ✅ **Functions or calculations**   | Helps label derived columns                                 |

## 🧠 Syntax

### 🔹 For Column Alias:

```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table;
```

OR (without `AS`, optional but recommended):

```sql
SELECT column_name alias_name FROM table;
```

### 🔹 For Table Alias:

```sql
SELECT t.name FROM employees AS t;
```

## 🛠️ Practical Examples

### 1. **Column Alias**

```sql
SELECT salary * 0.10 AS bonus
FROM employees;
```

🔹 Output column is named `bonus` instead of `salary * 0.10`

---

### 2. **Table Alias (especially in JOINs)**

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees AS e
JOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

🔹 Makes it easier to read and write — especially in large queries

---

### 3. **Alias in Subquery (Mandatory!)**

```sql
SELECT dept_name, emp_count
FROM (
    SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) AS dept_summary
JOIN departments AS d ON dept_summary.department_id = d.id;
```

🔹 The alias `dept_summary` is required to use the subquery as a table.

---

### 4. **Rename Output in Reports**

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM users;
```

🔹 Makes result more readable, useful for reports or export

## 🧑‍💼 Real-Life Use Cases

| Scenario                              | Alias Use                               |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Business report showing "Total Sales" | `SUM(amount) AS total_sales`            |
| Dashboard showing "Employee Name"     | `CONCAT(fname, lname) AS employee_name` |
| Join query with long table names      | `orders AS o`, `products AS p`          |
| API or frontend consuming SQL results | Clean output column names               |

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* Aliases make **complex queries readable** and **outputs meaningful**.
* Use for columns, tables, calculations, and subqueries.
* `AS` is optional, but using it is good practice for clarity.
* Required when using subqueries or functions in the `FROM` clause.
