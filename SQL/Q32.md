## ✅ What Is a Self Join?

A **self join** is a regular `JOIN`, but instead of joining two different tables, you **join the same table with itself** using aliases to distinguish between the two instances.

## 🔍 When to Use a Self Join?

| Use Case                                  | Real-Life Example                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 **Hierarchical data**                  | Employees reporting to managers (same table)                   |
| 📊 **Compare rows within the same table** | Find employees earning more than another employee in same dept |
| 🔗 **Relate rows in the same entity**     | Link products with related or similar products (same table)    |
| ⏳ **Track changes over time**             | Compare previous and current versions of a record              |

## 🛠️ Practical Examples

### 🔹 1. **Employees and Their Managers**

Imagine a table like this:

| id | name    | manager\_id |
| -- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1  | Alice   | NULL        |
| 2  | Bob     | 1           |
| 3  | Charlie | 1           |
| 4  | Dave    | 2           |

You want to show each employee **along with their manager's name**:

```sql
SELECT
  e.name AS employee_name,
  m.name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id;
```

✅ Here, the `employees` table is joined with itself:

* `e` is the employee
* `m` is the manager

---

### 🔹 2. **Find Employees in the Same Department with Higher Salaries**

```sql
SELECT
  e1.name AS employee,
  e2.name AS higher_paid_colleague
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.department_id = e2.department_id
WHERE e1.salary < e2.salary;
```

✅ Useful for comparisons **within the same table**.

---

### 🔹 3. **Identify Duplicates Based on Some Condition**

```sql
SELECT a.id, b.id
FROM users a
JOIN users b ON a.email = b.email AND a.id <> b.id;
```

✅ Finds users with **duplicate emails** but different IDs.

## 💡 Tips for Using Self Joins

| Tip                                     | Explanation                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Use table **aliases** (`e`, `m`)        | Required to distinguish the instances    |
| Prefer `LEFT JOIN` for optional matches | E.g., if not all employees have managers |
| Can combine with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`   | For advanced filtering or counting       |

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* Use **self joins** when rows in a table relate **to other rows in the same table**.
* Common in **employee-manager**, **product comparison**, **timeline analysis**.
* Always use **aliases** to avoid confusion.
* Works with any join type: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, etc.
