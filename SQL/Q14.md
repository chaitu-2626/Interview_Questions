### ✅ **Difference Between `UNION` and `UNION ALL` in SQL**

Both `UNION` and `UNION ALL` are used to **combine results from two or more SELECT queries**, but they handle duplicates differently and have different performance implications.

| Feature         | `UNION`                                        | `UNION ALL`                                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Duplicates**  | Removes duplicate rows                         | Includes all rows (duplicates allowed)              |
| **Performance** | Slower (because it does duplicate elimination) | Faster (no duplicate check)                         |
| **Use case**    | When you want a **distinct** combined result   | When you want **all results**, including duplicates |
| **Sorting**     | Performs implicit sort to remove duplicates    | No implicit sorting                                 |

### ✅ **Example:**

Suppose you have two tables: `Employees_US` and `Employees_UK`

```sql
-- Using UNION removes duplicates
SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employees_US
UNION
SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employees_UK;
```

```sql
-- Using UNION ALL includes all duplicates
SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employees_US
UNION ALL
SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employees_UK;
```

### ✅ **When to Use Which?**

* Use **`UNION`** if you want to ensure **no duplicate rows** in the result.
* Use **`UNION ALL`** if duplicates are acceptable or you want better performance.

---

### ✅ **Real-Life Analogy:**

* `UNION` is like combining two guest lists and removing duplicate names.
* `UNION ALL` is like combining two guest lists as-is, keeping everyone’s name.
