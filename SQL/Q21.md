## ✅ SQL Query Execution Order (Logical Processing Order)

Although we write SQL in the following order:

```sql
SELECT column
FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column
LIMIT number;
```

This is **not** the actual order in which SQL executes the query internally. Here's the **correct execution order**:

### 🔢 SQL Logical Execution Order:

| Step | Clause       | Purpose                                   |
| ---- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | **FROM**     | Identify the table(s) and perform `JOIN`s |
| 2️⃣  | **ON**       | Filter rows for `JOIN` conditions         |
| 3️⃣  | **JOIN**     | Combine tables                            |
| 4️⃣  | **WHERE**    | Filter rows before grouping               |
| 5️⃣  | **GROUP BY** | Group rows based on column(s)             |
| 6️⃣  | **HAVING**   | Filter groups after aggregation           |
| 7️⃣  | **SELECT**   | Select and compute final columns          |
| 8️⃣  | **DISTINCT** | Remove duplicates (if used)               |
| 9️⃣  | **ORDER BY** | Sort the result                           |
| 🔟   | **LIMIT**    | Limit the number of output rows           |

### 📘 Example for Better Understanding (with JOIN)

```sql
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.id) AS emp_count
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE e.salary > 50000
GROUP BY d.department_name
HAVING COUNT(e.id) > 3
ORDER BY emp_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### How SQL Executes It:

1. **FROM employees e** – Start with the `employees` table (aliased as `e`)
2. **JOIN departments d ON e.department\_id = d.id** – Join with `departments` to get department names
3. **WHERE e.salary > 50000** – Filter employees with salary above 50,000
4. **GROUP BY d.department\_name** – Group the remaining rows by department
5. **HAVING COUNT(e.id) > 3** – Keep only departments with more than 3 employees
6. **SELECT** – Select department name and employee count
7. **ORDER BY emp\_count DESC** – Sort departments by employee count, descending
8. **LIMIT 5** – Return only the top 5 departments

### 🔑 Key Takeaways

* `WHERE` filters **rows**, `HAVING` filters **groups**
* `FROM`, `JOIN`, and `ON` are executed **before** `SELECT`
* Knowing the **logical execution order** helps avoid bugs and improves performance
* This example covers **all major SQL clauses**, perfect for interview prep!
