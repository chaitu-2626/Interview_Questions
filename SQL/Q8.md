### ✅ **Can We Use `HAVING` Without `GROUP BY` in SQL?**

**Yes**, you **can use `HAVING` without `GROUP BY`**, but it only makes sense when you're using **aggregate functions** in the `SELECT` clause.

---

### ✅ **When is it Useful?**

If you want to apply a condition on an **aggregate function across the entire result set**, `HAVING` works **even without `GROUP BY`**.

---

### ✅ **Example:**

```sql
-- Check if total number of employees is greater than 10
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees
FROM Employees
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

* Here, we are **not grouping by any column**.
* But we still use `HAVING` to **filter based on the aggregate result** (`COUNT(*)`).

---

### ✅ **Why Not Use `WHERE` Here?**

Because `WHERE` **cannot use aggregate functions** like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, etc.

```sql
-- ❌ This will cause an error
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Employees
WHERE COUNT(*) > 10;
```

---

### ✅ **Real-Life Analogy:**

* `WHERE` filters individual items (like removing bad apples **before** weighing).
* `HAVING` checks the weight **after** collecting them all.

### ✅ Summary:

| Clause   | Works without `GROUP BY`? | Works with aggregates? |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `WHERE`  | ✅ Yes                     | ❌ No                   |
| `HAVING` | ✅ Yes                     | ✅ Yes                  |
