### ✅ **How to Select the First Row in Each Group in SQL (Greatest-N-Per-Group Problem)**

This is a common SQL interview question:

> "How do you get the **first row (or top N rows)** in **each group**?"

---

### 🎯 **Example Use Case:**

You have a `Sales` table:

| Region | Salesperson | Amount |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| East   | Alice       | 1000   |
| East   | Bob         | 1200   |
| West   | Carol       | 900    |
| West   | Dave        | 1100   |

You want to **get the top salesperson in each region**, based on `Amount`.

---

## ✅ Method 1: Using `ROW_NUMBER()` (Best Practice in Modern SQL)

### ✅ Works in: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL 8+, etc.

```sql
SELECT Region, Salesperson, Amount
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY Amount DESC) AS rn
    FROM Sales
) AS ranked
WHERE rn = 1;
```

✅ This returns the **highest amount per region**.

---

## ✅ Method 2: Using a Correlated Subquery (Good for Simpler Databases)

### Works in: MySQL < 8, older systems

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Sales s
WHERE Amount = (
    SELECT MAX(Amount)
    FROM Sales
    WHERE Region = s.Region
);
```

⚠️ If two people have the same top amount in a region, both will be returned.

---

## ✅ Method 3: Using `JOIN` and `MAX()`

```sql
SELECT s.*
FROM Sales s
JOIN (
    SELECT Region, MAX(Amount) AS MaxAmount
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY Region
) m ON s.Region = m.Region AND s.Amount = m.MaxAmount;
```

✅ This returns the top salespeople per region — similar to the correlated subquery approach.

---

### 🧠 Tip:

* Replace `ROW_NUMBER()` with `RANK()` if you want **ties**.
* Use `LIMIT N` or `WHERE rn <= N` to get **top N rows per group**.

### ✅ Summary:

| Method                       | Use When                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `ROW_NUMBER()` + `PARTITION` | Best for modern SQL (precise, flexible) |
| Correlated Subquery          | Works in older MySQL or small datasets  |
| `JOIN` with MAX              | Good for readable logic and portability |
