## üîÑ What is a Transaction in MySQL?

A **transaction** is a sequence of one or more SQL operations (queries) treated as a single logical unit of work. All operations inside a transaction either **complete successfully together** (commit) or **fail together** (rollback).

Transactions help keep your database **consistent, reliable, and safe** even in cases of errors, crashes, or concurrent access.

## ‚úÖ Key Properties of Transactions (ACID)

* **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction succeed or none do.
* **Consistency**: The database moves from one valid state to another.
* **Isolation**: Transactions don‚Äôt interfere with each other (controlled by isolation levels).
* **Durability**: Once committed, changes persist even if the system crashes.

---

## üîß When to Use Transactions?

* When you have **multiple related operations** that must succeed or fail together, e.g.:

  * Transferring money between bank accounts: debit one account and credit another.
  * Inserting data into multiple tables that depend on each other.
  * Updating inventory after an order is placed and updating sales records.
* To **prevent data corruption** due to partial updates.
* To **ensure data integrity** in concurrent environments.

## üõ† Basic Transaction Commands in MySQL

```sql
START TRANSACTION;  -- Begin the transaction

-- SQL statements here, e.g.:
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;  -- Make changes permanent
-- OR
ROLLBACK;  -- Undo changes if there is an error
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* Not all storage engines support transactions. Use **InnoDB**, which supports transactions, row-level locking, and foreign keys.
* By default, MySQL runs in **autocommit mode**, which means each statement is committed immediately unless you explicitly start a transaction.
* Use transactions carefully to avoid long locks that can hurt performance.


### üíª Node.js MySQL Transaction Example

```js
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');

async function transferMoney(fromAccountId, toAccountId, amount) {
  const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'your_user',
    password: 'your_password',
    database: 'your_database'
  });

  try {
    // Start transaction
    await connection.beginTransaction();

    // Debit from the source account
    const [debitResult] = await connection.execute(
      'UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?',
      [amount, fromAccountId]
    );
    if (debitResult.affectedRows === 0) {
      throw new Error('Source account not found or insufficient balance');
    }

    // Credit to the destination account
    const [creditResult] = await connection.execute(
      'UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE id = ?',
      [amount, toAccountId]
    );
    if (creditResult.affectedRows === 0) {
      throw new Error('Destination account not found');
    }

    // Commit transaction if all went well
    await connection.commit();
    console.log('Transaction committed successfully.');

  } catch (error) {
    // Rollback transaction on error
    await connection.rollback();
    console.error('Transaction failed, rolled back.', error.message);

  } finally {
    // Close connection
    await connection.end();
  }
}

// Usage example
transferMoney(1, 2, 100).catch(console.error);
```

### Explanation:

* `beginTransaction()` starts the transaction block.
* Two updates run: debit and credit.
* If anything fails (e.g., invalid account or insufficient funds), `throw` triggers rollback.
* `commit()` applies all changes atomically.
* Always close the connection in the `finally` block.

### Why use transactions here?

To ensure **both debit and credit happen together** or **not at all**, preventing issues like money disappearing or being created out of thin air.
