## 🎯 1. **Long-Polling**

> **Fake real-time** communication by repeating requests when no new data is available.

### 🔧 How it works:

```text
Client → Server: “Any updates?”
Server → Waits… then responds when something changes
Client → Waits a bit, asks again
```

### 🧠 Analogy:

It's like **asking your friend every 5 seconds** if they have any news.

✅ Easy to implement

❌ Wasteful: constant open/close connections

### Code Example (JS using Fetch):

```javascript
function poll() {
  fetch('/updates')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      updateUI(data);
      setTimeout(poll, 1000); // keep polling
    });
}
poll();
```

## 🔌 2. **WebSockets**

> **Full-duplex**, real-time communication over a single, persistent connection.

### 🔧 How it works:

* One-time handshake (HTTP ➞ WebSocket upgrade)
* Then: **Client and server can send messages anytime**

### 🧠 Analogy:

Like a **phone call** — both sides can talk at any time.

✅ Fast and lightweight

✅ Real-time two-way (chat, games, live collab)

❌ Slightly more complex to scale

### Code Example:

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://example.com/socket');

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('New message:', event.data);
};

socket.send('Hello from client');
```

---

## 📡 3. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**

> Server pushes messages to the client over a **simple HTTP stream**.

### 🔧 How it works:

* Browser opens HTTP connection
* Server **streams** updates as events

### 🧠 Analogy:

Like **subscribing to a newsletter** — server sends updates when available.

✅ Simple to use

✅ Built-in reconnection

❌ One-way only (server ➞ client)

❌ Not supported in old IE (works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Code Example:

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/events');

eventSource.onmessage = (e) => {
  console.log('Update:', e.data);
};
```

## 🎨 Visual Comparison

```
[ Client Request Flow ]

🔄 Long Polling:
Client --> Server (request)
           ↳ waits
Server --> Client (response)
Client --> Server (again...)
(repeats)

🔌 WebSocket:
Client →↔← Server (one handshake)
Then bidirectional messages continuously

📡 SSE:
Client --> Server (one request)
Server -->-->--> Client (stream of updates)
```

## 🧠 When to Use What?

| Scenario                     | Use This            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Simple updates (feeds, logs) | 📡 SSE              |
| Real-time chat, games        | 🔌 WebSockets       |
| Legacy browser support       | 🔄 Long-polling     |
| Server → Client only needed  | 📡 SSE or Long-poll |
| Client ↔ Server both needed  | 🔌 WebSockets       |
