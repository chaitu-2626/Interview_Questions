### ✅ What is an `<iframe>` in HTML?

An **`<iframe>`** (short for **inline frame**) is an HTML element that allows you to embed **another webpage** inside the current webpage.

---

### 🛠 How It Works

When the browser encounters an `<iframe>`, it loads the content of the URL provided in the `src` attribute as a **separate embedded document** within the current page.

---

### 📦 Basic Syntax

```html
<iframe src="https://example.com" width="600" height="400"></iframe>
```

This will display the `https://example.com` page **inside a 600x400 box** within your page.

### 🧠 Key Attributes

| Attribute         | Purpose                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `src`             | URL of the page you want to embed           |
| `width`/`height`  | Size of the iframe                          |
| `title`           | Accessibility (required for screen readers) |
| `allowfullscreen` | Allows full-screen if supported             |
| `loading="lazy"`  | Improves performance by lazy loading        |
| `sandbox`         | Adds extra security restrictions (optional) |

### 🔐 Security Tip: `sandbox` Attribute

```html
<iframe src="https://example.com" sandbox></iframe>
```

Adding `sandbox` disables scripts, forms, and other potentially risky behavior unless specifically allowed.

You can also fine-tune it:

```html
<iframe src="https://example.com" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms"></iframe>
```

### ❌ When Not to Use

* Don’t use if you can use APIs to get the data and render it yourself.
* Many websites (like Google, Facebook) block being shown in an iframe using headers like `X-Frame-Options`.

---

### ✅ Practical Use Case

Embedding a YouTube video:

```html
<iframe 
  width="560" 
  height="315" 
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" 
  title="YouTube video player" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

### 🧾 Summary

* `<iframe>` lets you embed external content like maps, videos, or full pages.
* Use it cautiously, especially with 3rd-party content.
* Add `title`, `loading="lazy"`, and `sandbox` for accessibility and security.
