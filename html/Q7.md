### How to Get Indexed Better by Search Engines

---

### 1. Use Meaningful, Semantic HTML

* Use proper heading tags `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc. to structure content.
* Use semantic tags like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`.

Example:

```html
<h1>Best Chocolate Cake Recipe</h1>
<section>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
  </ul>
</section>
```

---

### 2. Write Unique and Descriptive Title and Meta Description

* The `<title>` tag is critical â€” include main keywords.
* Use `<meta name="description" content="...">` to summarize page content.

Example:

```html
<title>Easy Chocolate Cake Recipe | Baking Tips</title>
<meta name="description" content="Learn how to bake a delicious chocolate cake with this easy recipe. Perfect for beginners!">
```

---

### 3. Use `alt` Attributes for Images

* Provide descriptive `alt` text for all images.

Example:

```html
<img src="cake.jpg" alt="Chocolate cake with frosting and strawberries">
```

---

### 4. Create Clean, Crawlable URLs

* Use readable URLs with keywords, avoid special characters or long query strings.

Example:

```
https://example.com/chocolate-cake-recipe
```

---

### 5. Include a Sitemap and Robots.txt

* Sitemap (`sitemap.xml`) helps search engines find all pages.
* `robots.txt` controls which pages to crawl.

---

### 6. Use Internal Linking

* Link related pages/posts to help search engines navigate your site.

Example:

```html
<a href="/chocolate-cake-tips">More Baking Tips</a>
```

---

### 7. Ensure Fast Loading and Mobile Friendliness

* Use the `<meta name="viewport">` tag for responsiveness.
* Compress images and minimize CSS/JS.

Example:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

---

### 8. Use Structured Data (Schema.org)

* Add schema markup to help search engines understand your content better.

Example (JSON-LD for an article):

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Easy Chocolate Cake Recipe",
  "author": "Jane Doe",
  "datePublished": "2025-06-05"
}
</script>
```
