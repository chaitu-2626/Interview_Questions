### When to Use the `<small>` Element?

* The `<small>` tag is used to represent **side comments**, **fine print**, or **legal disclaimers** — basically, text that is **less important or secondary** to the main content.
* It typically renders the text in a **smaller font size** by default.
* It’s **not** just for making text smaller visually — it conveys meaning about the text’s role.

### Appropriate Use Cases for `<small>`

* Copyright notices

### Important Notes

* Don’t use `<small>` just to style text smaller — use CSS if it’s purely visual.
* Use `<small>` when you want to **indicate the text is less important or supplementary**.
