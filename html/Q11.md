### What is Character Encoding?

**Character encoding** is a system that maps **characters (letters, numbers, symbols)** to **binary numbers** (ones and zeros) so computers can store and display text correctly.

---

### Why is it important?

* Computers only understand binary, so encoding tells the computer **how to interpret the bytes** as readable text.
* Different languages and symbols require different encodings.
* Without proper encoding, text can appear as **garbled or strange characters** (mojibake).

---

### Common Character Encoding

* **UTF-8** — The most popular encoding today, supports almost all characters and symbols in all languages.
* **ASCII** — Older encoding for basic English characters only.
* Other encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-16, etc.

### How to set Character Encoding in HTML?

Use the `<meta>` tag inside the `<head>`:

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

This tells the browser to interpret the page using UTF-8 encoding.

---

### Example

If you don’t specify encoding and your page contains non-English characters like “é” or “你好”, they might display incorrectly.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Character Encoding Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Accented character: é</p>
  <p>Chinese greeting: 你好</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Summary

* Character encoding maps text characters to bytes for computers.
* UTF-8 is the best practice because it supports all languages.
* Always set encoding in your HTML with `<meta charset="UTF-8">` to avoid display issues.
