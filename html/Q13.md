### What are `defer` and `async` attributes on `<script>`?

Both are **boolean attributes** you add to `<script>` tags to control **how and when JavaScript files are loaded and executed**.

---

### 1. `async`

* The script is downloaded **asynchronously** (in parallel with HTML parsing).
* Once the script is downloaded, it **executes immediately**, **pausing HTML parsing**.
* Scripts with `async` **do NOT guarantee order** — they execute as soon as ready.
* Best for independent scripts that don’t rely on other scripts or the DOM.

```html
<script src="script1.js" async></script>
<script src="script2.js" async></script>
```

* `script1.js` and `script2.js` may load and run **in any order**.

---

### 2. `defer`

* The script is downloaded **in parallel** with HTML parsing.
* The script **executes only after the HTML document is fully parsed**.
* Scripts with `defer` execute **in the order they appear** in the HTML.
* Best for scripts that need the DOM to be fully built before running.

```html
<script src="script1.js" defer></script>
<script src="script2.js" defer></script>
```

* `script1.js` runs **before** `script2.js`, and both run **after** HTML parsing completes.

---

### Without `async` or `defer`

* Scripts block HTML parsing — browser downloads and executes scripts immediately, pausing page rendering.
* Can cause slower page load and render blocking.

### Quick Summary

| Attribute | Downloading             | Execution timing                              | Order guaranteed? | Use case                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **none**  | Blocking                | Immediately, blocks parsing                   | N/A               | Critical scripts that must run immediately  |
| **async** | Parallel (non-blocking) | As soon as downloaded (may interrupt parsing) | No                | Independent scripts, e.g., analytics        |
| **defer** | Parallel (non-blocking) | After HTML parsing finishes                   | Yes               | Scripts that depend on DOM or order matters |

### Example usage

```html
<head>
  <script src="analytics.js" async></script>  <!-- Load independently -->
  <script src="app.js" defer></script>        <!-- Load after HTML parsed -->
</head>
```
