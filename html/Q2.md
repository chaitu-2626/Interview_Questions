| Use Case             | Explanation                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accessibility**    | Screen readers read `alt` text aloud for users who are visually impaired. |
| **Fallback Content** | If the image fails to load, the `alt` text is displayed in its place.     |
| **SEO**              | Search engines use it to understand image content for indexing.           |
| **Faster Browsing**  | On slow connections, users may see the `alt` text before the image loads. |

### üõ† Basic Example

```html
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A gray cat sitting on a windowsill">
```

If `cat.jpg` doesn‚Äôt load, users will see:
**"A gray cat sitting on a windowsill"**

### ‚ùå Bad Example

```html
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="image">
```

This doesn‚Äôt describe the image ‚Äî it's not helpful to users or screen readers.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è When to Leave `alt` Empty

If the image is **decorative only** (purely visual, no informational value), you can leave `alt=""`:

```html
<img src="border-line.png" alt="">
```

This tells screen readers to skip it, which improves accessibility.

### üßæ Summary

* Use `alt` to describe the image content **clearly and concisely**.
* Improves accessibility, SEO, and user experience.
* Use `alt=""` for purely decorative images.
