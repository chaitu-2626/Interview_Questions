### What is Cache Busting?

**Cache busting** is a technique used to **force browsers to load the most recent version** of a resource (like scripts, stylesheets, images) instead of using a cached (older) version.

Browsers cache files to speed up page load, but this can cause problems when you update files but users still see the old cached ones.

### Why is Cache Busting Important?

* Ensures users get the **latest updates and fixes**.
* Avoids issues where outdated CSS/JS breaks functionality or styling.
* Improves development and user experience.

### How to Achieve Cache Busting?

#### 1. **Version Query Parameters**

Add a version number or timestamp as a query string to the file URL.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css?v=1.2">
<script src="app.js?v=20250605"></script>
```

When you update your files, change the version (`v=1.3` or new date), so browsers treat it as a new resource.

#### 2. **Filename Versioning / Fingerprinting**

Rename files when you update them, usually by appending a hash or version to the filename.

Example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.9f8a7d.css">
<script src="app.a1b2c3.js"></script>
```

This is often automated by build tools like Webpack or Gulp.

#### 3. **HTTP Cache-Control Headers**

Control caching behavior on the server side by setting headers like:

* `Cache-Control: no-cache`
* `Cache-Control: max-age=0`

But versioning files (query params or filenames) is more reliable.

### Summary Table

| Method                  | Description                    | Pros                          | Cons                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Query String Versioning | Add `?v=1.2` to file URL       | Easy to implement             | Some proxies ignore query strings |
| Filename Versioning     | Rename files with version/hash | Most reliable, better caching | Requires build tools              |
| HTTP Headers            | Control caching from server    | Good for short-term control   | Needs server config               |

### Example:

```html
<!-- Old version -->
<script src="app.js?v=1.0"></script>

<!-- After update -->
<script src="app.js?v=1.1"></script>
```
