### What is a Self-Closing Tag?

A **self-closing tag** (also called a **void element**) is an HTML tag that **does not have any content** between an opening and closing tag.
Instead, it **closes itself within one tag**.

### Why use self-closing tags?

* They are used for elements that **donâ€™t need to wrap any content** (like images, line breaks, or inputs).
* Keeps HTML concise and clean.

### Common self-closing tags in HTML5:

| Tag       | Description                 | Example                                    |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `<img>`   | Image                       | `<img src="cat.jpg" alt="Cat">`            |
| `<br>`    | Line break                  | `Line 1<br>Line 2`                         |
| `<hr>`    | Horizontal rule (separator) | `<hr>`                                     |
| `<input>` | Form input element          | `<input type="text">`                      |
| `<meta>`  | Metadata about the document | `<meta charset="UTF-8">`                   |
| `<link>`  | Link to external resource   | `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` |

### Important notes:

* In **HTML5**, you just write them like `<img>`, `<br>`, without a slash.
* In **XHTML** or some XML-based syntaxes, you write them as `<img />`, `<br />` with a slash before the closing angle bracket.
* Browsers understand both, but modern HTML recommends **no slash** for self-closing tags.

### Example:

```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
<br>
<hr>
<input type="checkbox" checked>
```

### Summary:

* Self-closing tags **do not wrap content**.
* They are **written as a single tag** (no separate closing tag).
* Examples include `<img>`, `<br>`, `<input>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`.
* Use them for empty elements.
