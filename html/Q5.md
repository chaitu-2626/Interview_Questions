### Key Goals and Motivation behind HTML5 Specification

---

### 1. **Better Support for Multimedia and Graphics**

* Before HTML5, embedding audio, video, and graphics required plugins like Flash.
* HTML5 introduced native tags like `<audio>`, `<video>`, and `<canvas>` for **built-in support** without extra plugins.
* This made multimedia **more accessible and performant**.

---

### 2. **Improved Semantics**

* Earlier HTML versions lacked meaningful tags to describe page structure clearly.
* HTML5 introduced **new semantic elements** like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`.
* This improves **accessibility**, **SEO**, and **code readability**.

---

### 3. **Better Interactivity and APIs**

* HTML5 added APIs for richer web applications:

  * Offline storage with **Web Storage API** (`localStorage`, `sessionStorage`).
  * Drag and drop.
  * Geolocation.
  * Web Workers for background processing.
  * Offline apps via **Application Cache** (later replaced by Service Workers).

---

### 4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**

* Aim to make web apps work consistently across **desktops, tablets, smartphones**, and other devices.
* Responsive and flexible design with viewport control.

---

### 5. **Cleaner and More Consistent Syntax**

* Fix inconsistent parsing rules from previous HTML versions.
* Simplify error handling to reduce browser quirks.
* Enable modern features while maintaining backward compatibility.

---

### 6. **Open Web Platform**

* HTML5 is developed as an **open standard** by the W3C and WHATWG.
* Encourage innovation and reduce dependence on proprietary technologies.
