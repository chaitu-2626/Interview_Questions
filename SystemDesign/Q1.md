## 🌐 WebRTC vs Mesh vs SFU – Cheat Sheet for Beginners

### 🔷 1. What is WebRTC?

**WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)** is a **technology that allows web browsers and apps to communicate with each other directly** via video, audio, and data.

* ✅ **Open-source**, built into most modern browsers.
* ✅ Supports **peer-to-peer** communication.
* ❌ But how you connect peers is where Mesh or SFU comes in.

Think of **WebRTC as the engine**, and **Mesh/SFU as the routes** it can take.

### 🔷 2. What is Mesh?

#### ➕ Explanation:

* In a **mesh network**, **everyone connects directly to everyone else**.
* For `N` people, each person makes `(N - 1)` connections.

#### ➕ Visual:

```
3 users in a Mesh:
User A <-> User B
User A <-> User C
User B <-> User C
```

#### ✅ When to Use Mesh:

* Very **small groups** (2-3 users).
* You want **no server cost** for media routing.
* Example: **One-on-one video calls** (e.g., WhatsApp video call).

#### ❌ Limitations:

* Doesn't scale well.
* Each person’s bandwidth and CPU are used up as users increase.

#### 🎓 Example:

You build a **group study app** with 2-3 students video chatting — Mesh works well!

### 🔷 3. What is SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)?

#### ➕ Explanation:

* **Users send their media to a central server (SFU)**.
* The SFU **forwards streams** to other participants — but **doesn't process or mix** them.

#### ➕ Visual:

```
3 users using SFU:
User A --> SFU --> B & C
User B --> SFU --> A & C
User C --> SFU --> A & B
```

#### ✅ When to Use SFU:

* **Groups larger than 3-4 people**.
* You want to **save user bandwidth**.
* You want more **control** (mute, record, screen share).

#### ❌ Limitations:

* Requires server setup (but lighter than full mixing).
* A bit more complex to build than Mesh.

#### 🎓 Example:

You’re building a **virtual classroom app** with 10 students and 1 teacher — SFU is best.

### 🔷 4. Quick Comparison Table

| Feature         | WebRTC (Mesh)        | WebRTC (with SFU)      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Peer-to-peer    | Yes                  | Yes (to server)        |
| Server needed?  | No                   | Yes (for SFU)          |
| Best for        | 1-on-1 or 2-3 people | 4+ people              |
| Bandwidth usage | High on user devices | Lower on user devices  |
| Latency         | Very low             | Low                    |
| Scalability     | Poor                 | Good                   |
| Recording       | Hard                 | Easier (done at SFU)   |
| Example         | Video chat between 2 | Online class, webinars |

### 🔷 5. When Should I Use What?

| Use Case                  | Recommended Approach                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-on-1 call               | Mesh (no SFU needed)                             |
| Small group (2-3)         | Mesh                                             |
| Group chat (4-10 people)  | SFU                                              |
| Webinar (1 to many)       | SFU                                              |
| Classroom / Meeting       | SFU                                              |
| Very large streams (100+) | Use **MCU** or RTMP streaming (not WebRTC alone) |

---

### 🔷 6. Bonus: MCU? (Just FYI)

* **MCU (Multipoint Control Unit)**: Mixes all streams into one (like a YouTube video stream).
* ✅ Less load on user devices.
* ❌ More server cost, higher latency.
* Example: Zoom (for recorded webinars), or livestreams.

---

### 🔚 TL;DR Summary

* ✅ Use **Mesh** when it’s simple, 1-on-1, or low traffic.
* ✅ Use **SFU** when scaling, managing more people, or adding features.
* ❌ Avoid Mesh for big groups—it will kill bandwidth and CPU.
