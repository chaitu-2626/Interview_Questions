## What is `useDeferredValue`?

* `useDeferredValue` is a React Hook introduced in React 18.
* It **defers updating a value** until after more urgent updates have been rendered.
* Basically, it lets you keep a “stale” value while more important UI updates happen first, then React updates the deferred value in the background.

---

## Why use `useDeferredValue`?

* To **avoid blocking or slowing down the UI** during expensive rendering caused by rapid value changes.
* It helps **keep the app responsive**, especially during user input like typing or fast interactions.
* Unlike `useTransition`, which defers a whole update, `useDeferredValue` **defers just a value**, so you can keep your UI responsive while showing slightly outdated data that updates shortly after.

---

## How does it work?

```jsx
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
```

* You pass a value to `useDeferredValue`.
* React returns a **deferred version** of that value which may lag behind the original.
* React updates the deferred value when the app is idle or less busy.

---

## When to use `useDeferredValue`?

* When you have a **fast-changing input value** (like a search box), but you want to avoid expensive operations (like filtering large lists) running on every keystroke.
* To prevent **jank or sluggish UI** by rendering the expensive parts with a slightly delayed value.
* Works great when paired with large lists, complex calculations, or slow rendering components.

## Example

```jsx
import React, { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';

function Search() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);

  // Simulate expensive filtering
  const filteredList = bigList.filter(item =>
    item.includes(deferredQuery)
  );

  return (
    <>
      <input
        value={query}
        onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />
      <ul>
        {filteredList.map(item => (
          <li key={item}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

* The user’s fast typing updates `query` immediately.
* The filtering uses `deferredQuery`, which updates slightly delayed, preventing UI lag.

## Summary

| Hook               | Purpose                             | Use case                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `useDeferredValue` | Defer value updates for smoother UI | Fast-changing inputs + expensive renders     |
| `useTransition`    | Defer entire state updates          | Prioritizing urgent vs non-urgent UI updates |
