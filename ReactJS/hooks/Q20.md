### Why must custom hooks start with `use`?

* React relies on the **naming convention** to **identify hooks**.
* This is essential because React enforces the **Rules of Hooks**, which require hooks to be called only at the top level and not conditionally.
* The **React linter plugin** (`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`) uses the `use` prefix to detect hooks and warn you if you violate these rules.

---

### What happens if a custom hook doesn’t start with `use`?

1. **No linting support or warnings:**

   * React’s hook lint rules **won’t recognize your function as a hook**.
   * You **won’t get warnings** if you break rules like conditional calls inside this function.
2. **Potential bugs:**

   * Because React can't track it as a hook, **hook rules may be violated unknowingly**, causing bugs or inconsistent state.
3. **Confusion for developers:**

   * Naming hooks with `use` clearly signals intent and React-specific behavior.
4. **React itself does NOT enforce this at runtime:**

   * React won’t throw an error *just because* your hook is named wrong.
   * But you lose the **lint and dev tooling benefits**.

---

### Example:

```jsx
// Incorrect: custom hook without 'use' prefix
function fetchData() {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null); // This will work but no lint warning if misused
  // ...
  return data;
}
```

If you call `fetchData` conditionally or inside loops, React won’t warn you about breaking Rules of Hooks.

---

### Best practice:

* **Always prefix custom hooks with `use`** (e.g., `useFetchData`, `useCounter`).
* This ensures React tooling works and your code stays reliable.

| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| No automatic lint rule detection | Hook rules violations won't be caught  |
| Risk of breaking Rules of Hooks  | Leads to bugs or inconsistent behavior |
| No runtime React error           | React won’t block or error at runtime  |
| Developer confusion              | Naming signals intent and usage        |
