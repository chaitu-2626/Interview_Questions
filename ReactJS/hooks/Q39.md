## ✅ What is `useFormStatus`?

* `useFormStatus()` is a **React hook** that gives you the **status of a `<form>` submission**.
* It provides values like:

  * `pending`: Whether the form is currently submitting
  * `action`: The form action being submitted (useful with `action` props)
  * `method`: GET or POST

It's designed to be used **inside a `form`** — typically with the new **React `<form action={...}>`** + **server actions** or **async form handlers**.

## 🧑‍💻 Example Usage

```jsx
'use client'; // For React Server Components setup

import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';

function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();

  return (
    <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

```jsx
<form action={async (formData) => {
  // some async server action
}}>
  <input name="email" />
  <SubmitButton />
</form>
```

> ✅ This works great with **React Server Actions**, where form `action` handlers are declared as async server functions.

## 💡 When to use `useFormStatus`?

Use it when:

* You are working with **React Server Components** (e.g., in Next.js 14+ with App Router)
* You want to show:

  * A loading spinner during form submission
  * Disable the button while the form is submitting
  * Change the button label (e.g., "Sending...", "Please wait...")
* You want to **avoid writing local state (`useState`) to manage submission manually**

```ts
const {
  pending,  // boolean
  data,     // FormData being submitted
