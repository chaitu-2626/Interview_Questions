## What is `useTransition`?

* It's a **React Hook** introduced in React 18 to help **manage UI updates with different priorities**.
* It lets you mark some state updates as **“transitions”**, meaning React can delay rendering those updates to keep the UI responsive.
* This helps **avoid blocking the UI** during expensive renders by allowing React to show the current UI immediately and update the slower parts in the background.

---

## How does it work?

* `useTransition` returns two things:

  1. A function to start the transition.
  2. A boolean `isPending` that tells if the transition update is ongoing.

---

## Basic usage example

```jsx
import React, { useState, useTransition } from 'react';

function Search() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [list, setList] = useState([]);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  function handleChange(e) {
    const value = e.target.value;
    setQuery(value);

    // Mark this update as a transition
    startTransition(() => {
      // Simulate filtering a big list (expensive)
      const filtered = bigList.filter(item => item.includes(value));
      setList(filtered);
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input value={query} onChange={handleChange} />
      {isPending && <p>Loading results...</p>}
      <ul>
        {list.map(item => (
          <li key={item}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

* Typing in the input immediately updates the `query` state (high priority).
* The expensive filtering (`setList`) runs as a **transition (low priority)**.
* While filtering happens, React shows a fallback UI (`Loading results...`) to keep it smooth.

## When to use `useTransition`

* When you have **expensive UI updates** triggered by user input, like:

  * Filtering/searching large lists
  * Rendering complex components
  * Navigating between views
* To keep the app **responsive** by preventing UI blocking.

---

## Why should you use it?

* **Improves user experience** by avoiding janky, unresponsive UI.
* Lets React **prioritize urgent updates** (like typing or clicks) over less urgent ones (like rendering filtered results).
* Enables **concurrent rendering** behavior in React 18+.
