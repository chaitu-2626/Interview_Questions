### What is **Batching** in React?

**Batching** means React groups multiple state updates or DOM changes together **into a single render pass** instead of rendering after every single update.

---

### Advantages of Batching in React:

1. **Improved Performance:**

   * By batching multiple state updates, React reduces the number of renders and DOM manipulations.
   * This avoids unnecessary work and speeds up your app.

2. **Fewer Repaints and Reflows:**

   * The browser has to repaint and reflow the UI less often because React updates the DOM in bulk.
   * This saves processing time and improves smoothness.

3. **Consistent State:**

   * Batching ensures multiple state updates happen together, so the UI updates are based on the latest state.
   * Prevents intermediate inconsistent states from showing.

4. **Better Developer Experience:**

   * You can write multiple `setState` or `setXXX` calls without worrying about performance hits.
   * React automatically optimizes updates for you.

### Example Without Batching (Hypothetical):

```jsx
setCount(count + 1);
setName('Alice');
```

* Without batching, React would render **twice** â€” once after each update.

---

### Example With Batching:

* React batches these two updates and renders **once** after both finish.

---

### Note:

* React automatically batches updates inside React event handlers.
* With React 18 and later, **automatic batching** is extended to other async events like `setTimeout`, promises, etc.
