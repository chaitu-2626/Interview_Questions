### ✅ **What Does Batching Mean in React JS?**

**Batching** in React means **grouping multiple state updates into a single re-render** to improve performance.

Instead of re-rendering the component for **each individual state change**, React batches them together and renders only **once**.

---

### 🧠 **Why Batching?**

Without batching, each `setState` would trigger a separate re-render. Batching helps to:

* **Reduce the number of renders**
* **Improve performance**
* **Avoid layout thrashing (especially in the DOM)**

---

### 🛠️ **Example Without Batching (theoretical)**

```jsx
setCount(c => c + 1);
setName('John');
```

If React did **not batch** these, it would:

1. Re-render after `setCount`
2. Re-render again after `setName`

---

### ✅ **React Automatically Batches These:**

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(prev => prev + 1);
    setName('React');
    // ✅ Both updates are batched → one re-render
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Update</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 🚀 **React 18+ Feature: Automatic Batching Everywhere**

Before React 18, batching only happened inside:

* React event handlers (like `onClick`)
* `useEffect`, `useCallback`, etc.

Now with React 18+, **batching works in**:

* Promises
* `setTimeout`
* Native event handlers
* `async/await` blocks

📌 **Example:**

```jsx
// React 18: This is batched too!
fetchData().then(() => {
  setCount(c => c + 1);
  setName('React');
});
```

---

### ❗ When You Don’t Want Batching

You can use `flushSync` (from `react-dom`) to force updates to apply immediately:

```jsx
import { flushSync } from 'react-dom';

flushSync(() => setCount(1));
flushSync(() => setName('No Batching'));
```

### 🧪 **Interview Tip Summary**

> Batching in React groups multiple state updates into a single re-render for better performance. React 18 introduced automatic batching for asynchronous updates too, making rendering more efficient.
