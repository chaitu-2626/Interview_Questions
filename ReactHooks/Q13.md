### ✅ **Comparison of `useState` vs `useReducer` in React**

Both `useState` and `useReducer` are React Hooks used to manage **state** in **functional components**.

They serve **similar purposes**, but each has **different strengths and use cases**.

---

### 🧠 **Quick Comparison Table**

| Feature           | `useState`                                | `useReducer`                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Best for          | Simple state (booleans, strings, numbers) | Complex state logic or multiple related values |
| Syntax            | `[state, setState]`                       | `[state, dispatch]`                            |
| State updates     | Directly with new value                   | Through reducer function and action            |
| Code organization | Inline, quick                             | More structured, scalable                      |
| Performance       | Fine for small state logic                | Better for multiple updates in one go          |

---

### 🔁 **1. `useState` – Simpler and More Direct**

Best for **simple and independent pieces of state**.

📌 **Example: Counter**

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

✅ Pros:

* Easy to use and read
* Less boilerplate

❌ Cons:

* Can get messy with multiple or complex states

---

### 🔁 **2. `useReducer` – Better for Complex State**

Best for **complex state objects**, **multiple related state changes**, or when state changes depend on **previous state**.

📌 **Example: Counter with reducer**

```jsx
import { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

✅ Pros:

* Better for multiple values or complex state transitions
* More maintainable and scalable
* Logic is centralized in the reducer

❌ Cons:

* More verbose
* Slightly harder to read for simple cases

### 📌 **When to Use What**

| Scenario                                 | Use...       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Simple toggle, form input, counter       | `useState`   |
| Multiple related state values            | `useReducer` |
| State depends on previous state logic    | `useReducer` |
| Want Redux-style architecture (dispatch) | `useReducer` |
| Need quick and simple local state        | `useState`   |

---

### 🧪 **Interview Tip Summary**

> Use `useState` for simple, independent state values. Use `useReducer` when your state logic is complex, involves multiple sub-values, or benefits from a centralized reducer. `useReducer` is also great for making logic testable and more maintainable.
