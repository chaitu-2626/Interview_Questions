## What is `useActionState`?

`useActionState` is a React hook introduced in **React 19** (especially in the context of **React Server Actions** and the new form handling system).

### Purpose:

It lets you **track the current state of a server action** (e.g., a form submission or any server-side async action) in your client components.

---

## Why is it useful?

When you have a **server action** (an async function run on the server), you might want to:

* Know if the action is **pending** (loading),
* See if it **succeeded**,
* Handle **errors**,
* Display UI accordingly (like disabling a button, showing a spinner, or showing success/error messages).

`useActionState` gives you this status easily, **without manually managing state or side-effects**.

---

## What does `useActionState` provide?

Usually, it returns an object like:

```js
const { pending, error, data } = useActionState(action);
```

* `pending`: `true` if the action is currently running,
* `error`: contains error information if the action failed,
* `data`: the result returned from the server action (if successful).

---

## Simple example

```jsx
'use client';

import { useActionState } from 'react-dom';

async function myServerAction(formData) {
  // server logic here
  return { success: true };
}

function MyForm() {
  const actionState = useActionState(myServerAction);

  return (
    <form action={myServerAction}>
      <button type="submit" disabled={actionState.pending}>
        {actionState.pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
      </button>
      {actionState.error && <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{actionState.error.message}</p>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

---

## When to use `useActionState`?

* When working with **React Server Actions** (async server-side functions used as form handlers or actions)
* To provide **feedback on form submissions or other async server interactions**
* To avoid manually managing submission/loading/error state
