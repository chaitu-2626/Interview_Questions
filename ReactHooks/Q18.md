### Does React's `useState` update state immediately?

**No, it does NOT update state immediately.**

---

### How does `useState` update work?

* When you call the state setter function from `useState` (e.g., `setCount`), React **schedules the state update** but **doesn't update the state variable instantly**.
* The update happens **asynchronously** â€” React batches multiple state updates and applies them **before the next render**.
* This means the updated state value will be available **on the next render**, not immediately after calling `setState`.

---

### Example:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
    console.log(count);  // This will log the OLD value, not the updated count
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

* Here, `console.log(count)` logs the **previous** state, not the updated one.
* The updated `count` value will show up **on the next render**.

---

### Why?

* React batches updates for performance, so multiple `setState` calls inside the same event handler result in just **one render**.
* Updating synchronously would cause excessive re-renders and poor performance.

---

### How to get updated value after state change?

* Use `useEffect` to react to state changes:

```jsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Count updated:', count);
}, [count]);
```

| Fact                         | Explanation                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `useState` setter is async   | State changes happen on next render      |
| Current state variable stays | Same until React re-renders              |
| Updates are batched          | Multiple updates combined for efficiency |
