### 🚨 Problems with `useCallback`

---

#### 1. **Unnecessary Complexity**

* Adding `useCallback` where it’s not needed makes code **harder to read and maintain**.
* It often adds **boilerplate** without real performance benefits.

**Bad Example (overkill):**

```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('clicked');
}, []);
```

✅ Just write:

```jsx
const handleClick = () => {
  console.log('clicked');
};
```

---

#### 2. **Memory Overhead**

* `useCallback` itself adds **extra memory usage** to store the memoized function.
* If used too much, it can **hurt performance rather than help**.

---

#### 3. **Wrong Dependency Array**

* If you **forget a dependency**, the function might reference **stale values**.
* If you **add too many**, the function gets **recreated too often**, defeating the purpose.

**Example mistake:**

```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log(name); // uses "name"
}, []); // ❌ missing 'name' as a dependency
```

---

#### 4. **Doesn't Prevent Child Re-renders Unless Combined with `React.memo`**

* `useCallback` only **keeps function reference stable**.
* To actually prevent re-renders, the **child must be wrapped with `React.memo()`**.

**Misconception:**

> "`useCallback` by itself stops re-renders" → ❌ False

---

### ✅ When to Use `useCallback`

* You're passing a function to a **memoized child component** (`React.memo`) to **prevent unnecessary re-renders**.
* The callback is **expensive to re-create** (e.g., closures with heavy logic or API setup).
* You’re **stabilizing dependencies** for effects (e.g., `useEffect`, `useImperativeHandle`, `useMemo`).

### 🔁 Summary

| Issue                    | Explanation                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Overuse                  | Adds unnecessary complexity & memory cost         |
| Stale Closures           | Wrong/missing dependencies cause bugs             |
| Misused for optimization | No real benefit if not passed to a memoized child |
| Doesn't block re-renders | Only helps when combined with `React.memo`        |

### ✅ Interview Tip

> `useCallback` is a **performance optimization**, not a feature. Only use it when:
>
> * The function is passed to a memoized child,
> * Or the function is computationally expensive to recreate.
