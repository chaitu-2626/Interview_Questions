### ⚠️ **Are There Any Problems When Using `useContext` Hook in React?**

Yes — while `useContext` is incredibly useful, it does have **some pitfalls and limitations** you should be aware of, especially in **larger apps or performance-critical components**.

---

### 🚨 **Common Problems with `useContext`**

---

### 1️⃣ **Re-renders All Consumers on Value Change**

**Problem:**
If the context **value changes**, **all components using `useContext` will re-render**, even if they don’t care about the changed value.

📌 **Example:**

```jsx
<AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, isLoggedIn }}>
  <ComponentA /> // uses only `user`
  <ComponentB /> // uses only `isLoggedIn`
</AuthContext.Provider>
```

🔁 If `isLoggedIn` changes → **both A and B re-render**, even if A doesn't care.

✅ **Solution:**

* Split context into smaller, focused contexts (`UserContext`, `AuthStatusContext`)
* Use memoized values:

```js
const authValue = useMemo(() => ({ user, isLoggedIn }), [user, isLoggedIn]);
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Hard to Debug State Changes**

**Problem:**
Unlike Redux or Zustand, there's **no built-in devtool** to trace context updates or actions.

✅ **Solution:**
Use custom logging in dev mode or combine with `useReducer` for better state tracking.

---

### 3️⃣ **Tightly Coupled Components**

**Problem:**
If you access context **deep inside components**, it creates **tight coupling** to your app structure — harder to reuse components in other apps.

✅ **Solution:**
Use context **only at boundaries**, and pass props deeper when needed for reusable components.

---

### 4️⃣ **No Partial Updates**

**Problem:**
When context value is an object, **any property change causes a full re-render**, because React uses reference equality.

✅ **Solution:**

* Use multiple contexts for separate concerns
* Split big objects into granular pieces

```js
const ThemeContext = createContext();
const LanguageContext = createContext();
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Not Ideal for Frequent Updates**

**Problem:**
Don’t use `useContext` for values that change **very frequently** (like input text, mouse position, etc.)

✅ **Solution:**
Use local `useState` or `useReducer` inside the component for fast-changing data.

---

### 🧪 **Interview Tip Summary**

> While `useContext` simplifies global state access, it can lead to performance issues due to unnecessary re-renders and lacks built-in devtools. It's best used for stable or rarely-updated global values, and should be combined with `useReducer` or custom memoization when needed.
