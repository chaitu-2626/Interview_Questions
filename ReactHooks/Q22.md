### 🔧 What is `useLayoutEffect`?

`useLayoutEffect` is just like `useEffect`, but it **runs synchronously *after* the DOM is updated, but *before* the browser paints** the screen.

---

### ✅ Use Case

Use `useLayoutEffect` when:

* You **need to read layout or DOM measurements** right after React has made changes to the DOM
* You **want to prevent flickering** or visual glitches before the browser updates the screen

### 🧠 `useEffect` vs `useLayoutEffect`

| Feature         | `useEffect`                    | `useLayoutEffect`                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Timing          | After DOM is painted (async)   | After DOM updates, **before** paint (sync) |
| Use for         | API calls, subscriptions, etc. | Reading DOM size, position, scroll, etc.   |
| Blocking render | ❌ No                           | ✅ Yes – blocks painting until done         |
| Risk of jank    | 🚫 Safer performance           | ⚠️ Can block paint and hurt UX if misused  |

### 📦 Example: Measuring DOM size (e.g. for animations)

```jsx
import React, { useLayoutEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

function Box() {
  const boxRef = useRef(null);
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(0);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (boxRef.current) {
      const boxWidth = boxRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().width;
      setWidth(boxWidth);
    }
  }, []); // Run once after DOM mounts

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={boxRef} style={{ width: '50%' }}>Resize me</div>
      <p>Width: {width}px</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

* 🟢 **Why `useLayoutEffect`?** Because you need to measure the DOM *before* the screen is painted, to avoid showing wrong size briefly.

### 🧪 Summary

| Property                 | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Runs                     | After DOM update, **before paint**                |
| Use when                 | You need to **measure or manipulate DOM** layout  |
| Differs from `useEffect` | Yes — `useEffect` runs **after paint**            |
| Performance caution      | ⚠️ Slows paint if overused — use only when needed |

### ✅ Interview Tip

> Use `useLayoutEffect` **only when you need to block paint** for accurate DOM reads (e.g., layout, scroll, animations). For most side effects, `useEffect` is the better and safer choice.
