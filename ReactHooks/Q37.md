## 🧠 What is `useSyncExternalStore`?

* `useSyncExternalStore` is a React hook (introduced in **React 18**) used to **safely subscribe to external data sources** from within React components.
* It ensures your UI stays **synchronized** with **external stores** (like Redux, Zustand, or custom event listeners), even in **Concurrent Rendering and Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**.

---

## ✅ Why was it introduced?

Before React 18, we typically used `useEffect` to subscribe to external stores. This caused issues:

* Subscriptions happened **after render**, which could lead to **tearing** (where the UI reads stale data).
* Not safe in **Concurrent Mode** — state could be out of sync during re-renders or suspensions.
* Not SSR-compatible.

👉 `useSyncExternalStore` was introduced to solve these problems by allowing **synchronous and safe** reading from external sources.

## 🔁 What problem does it solve?

### 🔥 Problem: UI gets out of sync (tearing)

```jsx
const value = store.getState(); // UI reads the state directly (not safe with concurrent rendering)
useEffect(() => {
  store.subscribe(() => forceUpdate());
}, []);
```

👆 In concurrent rendering, `getState()` might return stale data because it’s read **outside of React’s lifecycle**.

---

## ✅ Solution: `useSyncExternalStore`

It lets React control **how and when** it reads from external sources, preventing tearing.

### 🔧 Syntax:

```js
const state = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot?);
```

| Parameter           | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `subscribe`         | Function that subscribes to store changes and returns an unsubscribe function |
| `getSnapshot`       | Function that returns the current value from the store                        |
| `getServerSnapshot` | Optional – used during server-side rendering                                  |

---

## 🧑‍💻 Practical Example

Let’s say you have a simple custom store (external to React):

```js
// store.js
let listeners = [];
let state = { count: 0 };

export const store = {
  getState: () => state,
  subscribe: (callback) => {
    listeners.push(callback);
    return () => {
      listeners = listeners.filter(l => l !== callback);
    };
  },
  increment: () => {
    state = { count: state.count + 1 };
    listeners.forEach(cb => cb());
  }
};
```

Now use it safely in React:

```jsx
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';
import { store } from './store';

function Counter() {
  const count = useSyncExternalStore(
    store.subscribe,
    () => store.getState().count
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={store.increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

✅ This is:

* Safe with **Concurrent Rendering**
* Consistent with **Server-Side Rendering**
* Avoids **stale or tearing data issues**

---

## 🧪 When should I use `useSyncExternalStore`?

Use it when:

* You're **subscribing to external non-React state**, like:

  * Redux (React 18+ internally uses this)
  * Zustand, Jotai, or other state libraries
  * Browser APIs like `window.matchMedia`
  * Custom data stores
* You need **SSR-safe**, consistent subscriptions
