### **Custom Hook vs Normal Function**

| Aspect                        | Custom Hook                                                        | Normal Function                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Naming convention**         | Must start with `use` (e.g., `useFetch`)                           | No naming rules                    |
| **Purpose**                   | Encapsulates reusable **React logic using hooks**                  | Performs any JavaScript task       |
| **Can call hooks?**           | Yes, can call React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect` inside      | No, cannot call React hooks safely |
| **Rules of Hooks apply**      | Must follow the **Rules of Hooks** (e.g., call only at top level)  | No restrictions                    |
| **Component lifecycle aware** | Runs as part of React’s render lifecycle (re-runs on renders)      | Runs only when explicitly called   |
| **Can use React features**    | Yes, manages state, side-effects, refs, context                    | No React internals access          |
| **Return value**              | Usually returns state, functions, or values related to React logic | Can return anything                |

### Why Use Custom Hooks?

* They **reuse stateful logic** between components without repeating code.
* They keep components **clean and focused** on UI.
* They leverage React’s hooks inside to manage state and effects.

### Example:

#### Custom Hook (`useCounter.js`)

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(c => c - 1);

  return { count, increment, decrement };
}

export default useCounter;
```

#### Normal Function (utility)

```jsx
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Summary:

* **Custom hooks** are special functions that let you use React hooks and React’s lifecycle features.
* **Normal functions** are just plain JavaScript functions with no React internals.
* You **cannot call React hooks inside normal functions** safely, but you **can** inside custom hooks (as long as you follow rules).
