## ✅ D – **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

> **High-level modules** should not depend on **low-level modules**.
> Both should depend on **abstractions** (interfaces).

### 🔑 Why it matters:

It makes your code **loosely coupled**, **testable**, and **easier to swap implementations**.

---

### 🔧 Real-World Backend Example (Node.js / Express)

Let’s say you have a service that **sends emails**.

---

### ❌ Bad: High-level code depends directly on low-level class

```js
class EmailService {
  send(email, message) {
    // logic to send real email
  }
}

class UserController {
  constructor() {
    this.emailService = new EmailService(); // tightly coupled
  }

  register(user) {
    this.emailService.send(user.email, 'Welcome!');
  }
}
```

👎 Problem:

* You can’t easily swap `EmailService` (e.g., for a mock in testing).
* Controller is tightly coupled to a specific implementation.

---

### ✅ Good: Invert dependency via abstraction (interface or constructor injection)

```js
// Define an interface-like abstraction
class IEmailService {
  send(email, message) {
    throw new Error('Not implemented');
  }
}

class RealEmailService extends IEmailService {
  send(email, message) {
    console.log(`Sending real email to ${email}: ${message}`);
  }
}

class MockEmailService extends IEmailService {
  send(email, message) {
    console.log(`[Mock] Email to ${email}: ${message}`);
  }
}

class UserController {
  constructor(emailService) {
    this.emailService = emailService; // depends on abstraction
  }

  register(user) {
    this.emailService.send(user.email, 'Welcome!');
  }
}
```

👨‍💻 Usage:

```js
// In production
const controller = new UserController(new RealEmailService());

// In tests
const testController = new UserController(new MockEmailService());
```

✅ Now the `UserController` can work with **any implementation** of `IEmailService`, real or mock.

## 🧠 Interview Answer Template

> The Dependency Inversion Principle helps separate high-level business logic from low-level details. In the backend, I use it to inject dependencies (like database, email, or cache services) via constructor or interfaces. This improves testability and makes my code more modular and flexible.

## ✅ Recap: All 5 SOLID Principles (with Mnemonic)

| Letter | Principle Name        | Purpose                                   |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **S**  | Single Responsibility | One reason to change                      |
| **O**  | Open/Closed           | Extendable without modifying core         |
| **L**  | Liskov Substitution   | Subclasses replace base without issues    |
| **I**  | Interface Segregation | No forcing unused methods                 |
| **D**  | Dependency Inversion  | High-level modules depend on abstractions |
