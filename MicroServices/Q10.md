# 🗄️ How Should Microservices Share Common DB Schema?

> 💡 **Short answer**:
> ➡️ **They shouldn’t.**
> Each microservice **must own its own data** and manage its **own schema**.
> Never **share a single database schema** between multiple services.

Let’s break this down clearly and practically 👇

## 🚫 Why NOT Share a Common DB Schema?

| Problem                  | Why It’s Bad                                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **Tight Coupling**     | If one service changes the schema, others break                |
| ❌ **Deployment Lock-In** | You can’t deploy services independently                        |
| ❌ **Blame Game**         | Teams fight over ownership of tables/columns                   |
| ❌ **Scaling Problems**   | Can’t optimize DB schema per service (e.g., indexes, sharding) |
| ❌ **Security**           | One service could read or write sensitive data of another      |
| ❌ **Hard to Migrate**    | Upgrading to new tech (e.g., SQL → NoSQL) becomes painful      |

## ✅ Correct Way: **Database per Service Pattern**

> 🧱 Each service has **its own database** and **full control** over its schema.

```
[User Service]  → PostgreSQL  
[Order Service] → MongoDB  
[Product Svc]   → MySQL  
[Inventory Svc] → Redis  
```

> No shared tables. No direct cross-service SQL joins. 🔒

## 🔁 But What If Two Services Need the Same Data?

There are 3 options (all interview-friendly) ✅

---

### ✅ 1. **API Calls Between Services**

> Services communicate over REST or gRPC

📦 Example:

```js
// Order Service needs user info
const user = await axios.get(`http://user-service/users/${userId}`);
```

📌 Decouples data, encourages API ownership
📌 Can implement caching to improve performance

---

### ✅ 2. **Data Duplication (Read-Only Projections)**

> Use **event-driven architecture** (Kafka, RabbitMQ) to sync necessary data between services

📦 Example:

* User Service emits: `user_created`, `user_updated`
* Order Service stores a **read-only copy** of basic user info

This pattern is called **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

```
[User Service] → emits "user_created"
     ↓
[Order Service] → stores `userId`, `email`, `name`
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Shared Library for Common Models** (✅ with care)

> If services are written in the **same language**, you can share a **library with common types** (not schema).

📦 Example (Node.js):

```ts
// common/models/User.ts
export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

📌 **Don’t share actual ORM/DB code** — just interfaces/types.

## 💬 Interview-Worthy Rule of Thumb:

> "In microservices, each service must own its own data. Services can talk over APIs or use events to share data — but never share the same database schema. This decouples systems and supports scalability and autonomy."

| Design Principle     | Use This                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Shared DB          | 🚫 Bad practice                           |
| ✅ DB per Service     | 🟢 Best practice                          |
| 🗣️ Need shared data | 🔁 Use API or ✉️ Event-driven sync        |
| 📚 Shared types      | ✅ Only for types/interfaces, not DB logic |
