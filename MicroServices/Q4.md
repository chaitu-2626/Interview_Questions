# 🔄 Proxy Server vs Reverse Proxy Server

Let’s break it down in a beginner-friendly, cheat-sheet style.

---

## 🧭 1. **Proxy Server (Forward Proxy)**

### ✅ What It Does:

A **proxy server** sits **between the client (user)** and the internet.
It acts on behalf of the **client**, forwarding requests to external servers.

### 📦 Example:

```
[Client] → [Proxy Server] → [Internet]
```

> 💬 "Client wants to go to Google, but goes through a **proxy** first."

### 🔍 Use Cases:

* Hide client's IP address (anonymity)
* Bypass network restrictions (firewalls)
* Control internet usage (in schools, companies)
* Cache outgoing requests

---

### 🧠 Analogy:

🕵️ Think of it like a **middleman** helping you browse the internet *without revealing your identity*.

## 🔄 2. **Reverse Proxy Server**

### ✅ What It Does:

A **reverse proxy** sits **in front of one or more backend servers** and **acts on behalf of the server**.

### 📦 Example:

```
[Client] → [Reverse Proxy] → [Backend Servers]
```

> 💬 "Client doesn’t know what servers are behind — reverse proxy handles routing and security."

### 🔍 Use Cases:

* Load balancing
* SSL termination
* Caching static responses
* Hiding backend infrastructure
* Rate limiting & security

---

### 🧠 Analogy:

🎭 Think of it like a **reception desk** — you talk to one person (reverse proxy), and they decide which employee (backend) to route you to.

## 🆚 Comparison Table

| Feature               | Proxy Server (Forward)     | Reverse Proxy Server             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Acts on behalf of     | 🔄 **Client**              | 🔁 **Server/Backend**            |
| Client knows backend? | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No (hidden behind proxy)       |
| Use Case              | Internet access, anonymity | Load balancing, routing, caching |
| Security use          | Hides client               | Hides backend infrastructure     |
| Common tools          | Squid, CCProxy             | Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik, Envoy   |

## 🛠 Node.js Microservices Example (Using Reverse Proxy)

Let’s say you have:

* `user-service` on port 3001
* `product-service` on port 3002
* `order-service` on port 3003

### 🔁 Use **Nginx** as a reverse proxy:

```nginx
# nginx.conf
server {
  listen 80;

  location /users {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
  }

  location /products {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3002;
  }

  location /orders {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3003;
  }
}
```

This hides your internal microservices and exposes **one public endpoint**.

## 💬 In Interview:

> *"A proxy server hides the client from the server, while a reverse proxy hides the backend from the client. In microservices, reverse proxies like Nginx or API gateways are used to route requests, apply auth, rate limiting, and load balancing."*
