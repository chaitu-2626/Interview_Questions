# 🧱 How Microservices Architecture Works

## 🔍 Quick Definition Recap:

> Microservices Architecture breaks a big application into **smaller, independent services** — each doing **one business function**, running independently, and communicating with others over **network protocols** like HTTP or message queues.

---

## 🛠️ 1. **Each Microservice Is a Mini-App**

Each service has:

* Its own **codebase**
* Its own **database**
* Runs in its own **process (Docker container)**
* Can be built with its own **tech stack (Node.js, Python, Go)**

🧱 Example E-commerce system:

* 👤 `User Service` → Login, JWT Auth
* 🛒 `Product Service` → Product listing
* 📦 `Order Service` → Cart, Checkout
* 💳 `Payment Service` → Stripe, Payments

---

## 🧩 2. **Services Talk to Each Other**

Communication happens via:

* 🔁 **REST APIs** → HTTP (`axios`, `fetch`, `express`)
* 📬 **Message Queues** → Async (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams)

### 🔗 Example: Product Service calls User Service

```js
// Order service calls product-service
const axios = require('axios');

async function getProduct(productId) {
  const res = await axios.get(`http://product-service:3001/products/${productId}`);
  return res.data;
}
```

---

## 🌐 3. **API Gateway as Entry Point**

> Instead of clients calling services directly, everything goes through an **API Gateway**.

📥 Client → 🛂 **API Gateway** → 🚪 Routes to correct microservice

🔧 Example (Nginx config):

```nginx
location /products {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
}
```

**Gateways** also handle:

* Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
* Rate limiting
* Load balancing
* Logging/Tracing

---

## 🗃️ 4. **Each Service Has Its Own Database**

> Microservices follow **Database per Service** pattern.

✅ This avoids tight coupling and allows services to scale, change schema, or even tech stack freely.

```
[User Service] → PostgreSQL  
[Product Service] → MongoDB  
[Order Service] → MySQL  
```

---

## 🛠️ 5. **Service Discovery (Optional)**

> In large systems, services don’t hardcode addresses. They use **service discovery** to find each other.

🛠 Tools:

* Eureka (Netflix)
* Consul
* Kubernetes DNS-based discovery

---

## 💣 6. **Fault Tolerance & Resilience**

> Services may fail. You need:

* Timeouts
* Retries
* Circuit breakers

```js
try {
  const res = await axios.get("http://payment-service/pay");
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Payment service failed. Retrying or falling back.");
}
```

---

## 📦 7. **Containerization (Docker)**

Each service runs in an **isolated Docker container**, so it's portable and environment-agnostic.

```bash
docker build -t user-service .
docker run -p 3000:3000 user-service
```

🔗 Then orchestrate them with **Docker Compose** or **Kubernetes**.

---

## 📈 8. **Monitoring, Logging, Tracing**

Use tools to track and debug:

* 📊 **Prometheus + Grafana** → Metrics
* 📜 **Winston**, **Bunyan** → Logs
* 🔍 **Jaeger**, **Zipkin** → Tracing

---

## 🔐 9. **Authentication & Authorization**

* Use a **central Auth service** for login, JWT token issuance
* All other services verify tokens in headers

```js
// Middleware to check token
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization;
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secret');
  req.user = decoded;
  next();
}
```

## ✅ How Microservices Architecture Works — Cheat Sheet

| Concept                  | Explanation                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Independent Services** | Each microservice does one job     |
| **Own DB per Service**   | Isolated data, no shared schema    |
| **API Gateway**          | Routes client requests             |
| **REST / Message Queue** | Service communication (sync/async) |
| **Fault Tolerance**      | Use timeouts, retries, fallbacks   |
| **Containerized**        | Docker + Kubernetes                |
| **Monitoring**           | Prometheus, Grafana, Winston       |
| **Auth**                 | Central JWT-based Auth Service     |

## 💬 Interview Tip:

> "Microservices work by splitting an app into independent services that communicate over APIs or events. This makes scaling, testing, and deploying easier — but it also introduces complexity like service discovery, communication, and resilience patterns."
