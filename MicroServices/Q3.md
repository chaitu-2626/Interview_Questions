# 🧱 Fundamentals of Microservices Design (Beginner + Interview Ready)

Let’s break this down like a clean cheat sheet:

---

## 🔑 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

> 📌 Each microservice should focus on **one business capability only**.

✅ For example:

* 🛍️ Product Service → Manages products only
* 👤 User Service → Handles registration, login, JWT
* 📦 Order Service → Manages orders, payments

🔍 **Why:** Keeps services simple, isolated, and easier to manage/debug/test.

---

## 🔑 2. **Loose Coupling, High Cohesion**

> 📌 Services should interact **minimally** and be **self-contained** internally.

🔗 Microservices **should not depend too much** on each other’s internal logic or DB.

🧠 Analogy: Think of them like departments in a company. HR doesn’t directly query Finance’s database; they **send a request**.

---

## 🔑 3. **Decentralized Data Management**

> 📌 Each service **owns its own database**.

| 🚫 Bad Practice            | ✅ Good Practice             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Shared DB between services | Each service has its own DB |

🎯 Example:

* User Service → `users.db`
* Product Service → `products.db`
* Order Service → `orders.db`

This avoids tight coupling and helps with **scalability + isolation**.

---

## 🔑 4. **API-First Design**

> 📌 Each service exposes its functionality via **HTTP APIs** or **Messaging Queues**.

✔️ Clients or other services call APIs like:

```http
GET /products
POST /orders
```

📦 Use tools like:

* **REST (Express.js, Fastify)**
* **gRPC** (when speed/efficiency is critical)
* **Message Brokers** (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for async communication

---

## 🔑 5. **Inter-Service Communication**

> 📌 Services talk using:

* 🔁 **Synchronous** (REST APIs using Axios, Fetch)
* 📬 **Asynchronous** (Message brokers like RabbitMQ, Kafka)

### 🧪 Node.js Example (Calling another service):

```js
const axios = require('axios');

const getUserData = async (id) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`http://user-service:3000/users/${id}`);
  return response.data;
};
```

---

## 🔑 6. **Service Discovery**

> 📌 Automatically find other services without hardcoding URLs

🛠️ Tools like:

* Consul
* Eureka
* Kubernetes DNS

🔍 For beginners: In Docker Compose, you can use service names to connect:

```yaml
depends_on:
  - user-service
```

---

## 🔑 7. **Fault Tolerance & Resilience**

> 📌 Your service should **gracefully handle** when others fail

🧰 Use:

* **Timeouts**
* **Retries with backoff**
* **Circuit Breakers** (e.g., `opossum` library)

```js
const axios = require('axios');
try {
  const res = await axios.get('http://order-service:3002/orders');
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Order service is down, returning fallback response');
}
```

---

## 🔑 8. **Scalability**

> 📌 Each service should be independently **scalable** based on load.

* Payment service overloaded? Scale only it.
* Done using **Docker + Kubernetes**, or AWS ECS/Lambda, etc.

---

## 🔑 9. **Monitoring, Logging & Tracing**

> 📌 Essential for debugging microservices

🛠 Tools:

* **Logging**: Winston, Bunyan
* **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

---

## 🔑 10. **Security (Auth & API Gateways)**

> 📌 Centralized security for all services

Use:

* **JWT tokens** passed between services
* **API Gateway** to handle:

  * Auth
  * Rate limiting
  * Routing

---

## 🔑 11. **CI/CD & DevOps Automation**

> 📌 Automated testing, building, and deployment per service.

📦 Tools:

* GitHub Actions
* Jenkins
* Docker + Kubernetes
* Helm Charts
