# 🔄 REST vs GraphQL — Explained

## 📘 1. What is REST?

**REST** (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style for APIs where:

* You expose **multiple endpoints** like `/users`, `/products`, `/orders`
* Each endpoint returns a **fixed data structure**
* Operates over **HTTP verbs**: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`

### 🧱 REST Example (Node.js + Express)

```js
// REST endpoint for getting a product
app.get('/products/:id', (req, res) => {
  const product = { id: 1, name: "iPhone", price: 999 };
  res.json(product);
});
```

## 🔍 2. What is GraphQL?

**GraphQL** is a **query language for APIs** developed by Facebook that allows:

* Clients to **ask exactly for the data they need**
* Use a **single endpoint** (`/graphql`)
* Fetch nested/related data in **one request**

### 🌐 GraphQL Example (Node.js + Apollo Server)

```js
const { gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Product {
    id: ID
    name: String
    price: Float
  }

  type Query {
    product(id: ID!): Product
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    product: () => ({ id: 1, name: "iPhone", price: 999 }),
  },
};
```

### 🔍 Query:

```graphql
query {
  product(id: 1) {
    name
    price
  }
}
```

### ✅ Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "product": {
      "name": "iPhone",
      "price": 999
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

| API Type    | Analogy                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **REST**    | Like a **restaurant menu** with predefined combos. You ask for `/products`, and get a fixed response. |
| **GraphQL** | Like a **buffet** where you pick exactly what you want on your plate — no more, no less.              |

## 🔄 Key Differences

| Feature                 | REST                                | GraphQL                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 📦 Endpoint Structure   | Multiple endpoints (e.g., `/users`) | Single endpoint (`/graphql`)       |
| 📋 Data Retrieval       | Fixed structure                     | Flexible & client-defined          |
| 🔁 Over/Under Fetching  | Common (too much/little data)       | Avoided — you request exact fields |
| 📥 Batch/Nested Queries | Multiple calls                      | One call with nested query         |
| ⚙️ Versioning           | Usually `/v1`, `/v2` URLs           | No versioning needed               |
| 🧪 Tooling              | Postman, Swagger                    | GraphiQL, Apollo Playground        |
| ⚡ Performance           | Simple for small apps               | Efficient for complex UIs          |
| 🚧 Error Handling       | HTTP codes (400, 500, etc.)         | Structured error responses         |

## ✅ Use Cases

| Use When...                        | REST             | GraphQL    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| 💡 App is simple & CRUD            | ✅                | ❌          |
| 📱 Mobile clients need flexibility | ❌                | ✅          |
| 🔗 Nested, relational data         | ❌ Multiple calls | ✅ One call |
| 🛠 Devs prefer clear HTTP methods  | ✅                | ❌          |
| 🚀 Data-driven UIs (React, Vue)    | ❌                | ✅          |

## 💬 Interview Tip

> “REST is great for simple, resource-based APIs. But when you have complex frontends (e.g. React apps) needing multiple nested resources in a single request, **GraphQL gives you more flexibility** and reduces network calls.”
