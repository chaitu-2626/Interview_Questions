# üßæ JavaScript Debouncing & Throttling Cheat Sheet

## ‚ö° Why Debounce/Throttle?

> To **optimize performance** of functions that fire **frequently**, such as:

* `scroll`
* `resize`
* `input`
* `mousemove`
* button `clicks`

‚úÖ Prevent unnecessary DOM updates
‚úÖ Improve responsiveness
‚úÖ Save API/bandwidth

## üîÅ Debouncing

### üìå Definition:

> **Delays execution** until a specified time has passed **after the last event**.

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* Search input autocomplete
* Window resize
* Form validation

### üß™ Example:

```js
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

// Usage
const handleInput = debounce(() => console.log("Typing..."), 500);
input.addEventListener("input", handleInput);
```

üìå Execution: After **500ms** of inactivity
üß† Think: *"Wait until user is done typing."*

## üåÄ Throttling

### üìå Definition:

> Ensures a function is **only called once every X ms**, **ignoring extra calls** during that time.

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* Scroll position updates
* Button spam prevention
* Resize event optimization

### üß™ Example:

```js
function throttle(fn, limit) {
  let inThrottle = false;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!inThrottle) {
      fn.apply(this, args);
      inThrottle = true;
      setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
    }
  };
}

// Usage
const handleScroll = throttle(() => console.log("Scroll event"), 200);
window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
```

üìå Execution: Every **200ms**, at most
üß† Think: *"Allow once every X ms."*

## üîç Debounce vs Throttle

| Feature       | Debounce                       | Throttle                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| When executed | After delay ends (pause)       | At regular intervals                |
| Prevents      | Function from firing too often | Function from firing too frequently |
| Ideal for     | Input fields, form validation  | Scroll, resize, mousemove           |
| User feedback | Slower but more precise        | Faster but less precise             |

## üß† Interview Q\&A

* What is debouncing/throttling and why do we need them?
* Can you implement them manually?
* When would you choose one over the other?
* How are `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` used in debouncing?
* What happens if you throttle a resize event handler?

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Use **debounce** for **"end of burst"** (e.g., user stops typing)
* Use **throttle** for **"periodic sampling"** (e.g., scroll/resize)
* Tune delay (ms) based on UX needs
* Use lodash's `_.debounce()` or `_.throttle()` for production-ready versions
