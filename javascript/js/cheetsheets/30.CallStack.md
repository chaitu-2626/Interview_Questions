# 📘 JavaScript Cheat Sheet: Call Stack

## 🧠 What is the Call Stack?

> 🧱 The **Call Stack** is a **stack-based data structure (LIFO)** used by JavaScript to keep track of **function execution**.

When a function is called:

* It’s **pushed** onto the stack.
  When it finishes:
* It’s **popped** off the stack.

## 🧮 Visualizing the Call Stack

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

function sayHi() {
  greet();
}

sayHi();
```

📦 Call Stack Flow:

```
⬆ PUSH: sayHi()
⬆ PUSH: greet()
⬇ POP:  greet()
⬇ POP:  sayHi()
```

## 🔂 Real-Time Call Stack Behavior

### Code:

```js
console.log('A');

function first() {
  console.log('B');
  second();
}

function second() {
  console.log('C');
}

first();
console.log('D');
```

### Call Stack Order:

```
1. Global Context
2. console.log('A') ✅
3. first() → PUSH
4. console.log('B') ✅
5. second() → PUSH
6. console.log('C') ✅
7. POP second()
8. POP first()
9. console.log('D') ✅
```

**Output:**

```
A  
B  
C  
D
```

## 🧯 Stack Overflow

> Happens when the stack **exceeds its limit** — often due to **infinite recursion**.

```js
function recurse() {
  recurse(); // ❌ Unbounded recursive call
}

recurse(); // 🔥 RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

## ⚙️ Where the Call Stack Fits

🔗 The Call Stack is part of the **JavaScript Runtime**:

```
[ Call Stack ]
      ↓
[ Web APIs ] ← Async (timers, DOM events, fetch)
      ↓
[ Callback / Task Queue ]
      ↓
[ Event Loop ]
```

## 📌 Interview Nuggets

* ✅ Call Stack is **synchronous**.
* ❌ It **doesn't handle async tasks** directly — async work (e.g., `setTimeout`) is offloaded to Web APIs.
* ✅ Used for **debugging** (stack traces) — each function’s context appears in reverse order.

## 🔍 Common Questions in Interviews

| Question                                  | What to Focus On                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “What happens when a function is called?” | It’s **pushed** to the stack.                |
| “Why do we get stack overflow?”           | **Recursive functions** without a base case. |
| “Why doesn’t async block the stack?”      | Async is handled **outside** the call stack. |

## 🎯 Pro Interview Quote

> “The Call Stack is how JavaScript keeps track of ‘where it is’ in the program — it pushes function calls on top, pops them off when they return, and crashes if the stack gets too deep.”
