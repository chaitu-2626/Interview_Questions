### 1. **Data Fetching and Timing Issues**

**Challenge:**

* SSR needs fresh data on every request, while SSG generates pages at build time. Handling data that changes frequently or is user-specific can be tricky.
* Sometimes you donâ€™t want stale data in static pages.

**Solution:**

* Use **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** in Next.js to update static pages after build on a schedule or on-demand.
* For user-specific data, combine SSR (`getServerSideProps`) with client-side fetching (React hooks) to hydrate dynamic parts.
* Cache APIs wisely and use stale-while-revalidate strategies.

### 2. **Performance Bottlenecks**

**Challenge:**

* SSR can cause slower Time to First Byte (TTFB) if data fetching or rendering is slow.
* SSG can lead to long build times for large sites.

**Solution:**

* Optimize data fetching with efficient queries and caching layers (Redis, CDN caching).
* Break big pages into smaller components and leverage dynamic imports for lazy loading.
* For very large sites, use ISR to avoid full rebuilds.
* Use CDN aggressively for static assets.

### 3. **Handling Authentication and Personalization**

**Challenge:**

* SSR runs on the server without access to browser-only info (like cookies or local storage), making auth tricky.
* SSG produces the same static HTML for all users, so personalizing content is hard.

**Solution:**

* Use SSR (`getServerSideProps`) to access cookies and auth tokens on server.
* For personalization on SSG pages, render common static content and fetch user-specific data client-side.
* Use middleware in Next.js to handle auth checks and redirects before rendering.

### 4. **SEO and Dynamic Routes**

**Challenge:**

* Ensuring SEO-friendly pages with dynamic content or routes that change often.
* Generating all dynamic paths at build time (with `getStaticPaths`) may be impossible for large or unpredictable datasets.

**Solution:**

* Use fallback modes (`blocking`, `true`) in `getStaticPaths` to build pages on-demand.
* Combine SSR for frequently changing/dynamic routes.
* Generate sitemap dynamically.

### 5. **Debugging Server vs Client Differences**

**Challenge:**

* Code running on server and client may behave differently (e.g., DOM APIs on server cause errors).
* Hydration mismatches causing React warnings or broken UI.

**Solution:**

* Write isomorphic-safe code (check for `typeof window !== 'undefined'`).
* Use dynamic imports with `{ ssr: false }` for client-only components.
* Thoroughly test hydration paths and console warnings.
