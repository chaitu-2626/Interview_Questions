## ðŸ“Œ Key Differences Between Next.js API Routes and Node.js API Routes

| Feature                       | Next.js API Routes                                                      | Node.js API Routes (e.g., Express)                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setup & Boilerplate**       | Minimal setup â€” just create files in `pages/api` or `app/api`           | Requires explicit setup (Express app, middleware, routing)                        |
| **Server Environment**        | Runs as serverless functions (serverless or edge runtime)               | Runs as a persistent Node.js server process                                       |
| **Routing**                   | File-system based routing (each file = route)                           | Manual route definitions with `.get()`, `.post()`, etc.                           |
| **State & Long-lived Server** | Stateless and ephemeral â€” no memory between requests                    | Persistent server, can store in-memory state (though not recommended for scaling) |
| **Middleware Support**        | Limited middleware, but supports middlewares like `next-connect`        | Full control over middleware (Express, cors, body-parser, etc.)                   |
| **Performance & Scalability** | Scales automatically in serverless environments                         | Needs manual scaling, deployment, clustering                                      |
| **Use Case**                  | Best for lightweight backend logic, API proxying, authentication        | Suitable for complex backend apps, custom APIs, websockets                        |
| **Custom Server Control**     | No control over the underlying server â€” abstraction provided by Next.js | Full control (listening ports, sockets, protocols)                                |

## Example:

### Next.js API Route

```js
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js API!' });
}
```

No server or express app needed â€” just the file!

---

### Node.js with Express

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express!' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running'));
```

You manage everything yourself here.

## ðŸ’¡ Summary

* **Next.js API routes** are **serverless, simple, and tightly integrated** with your Next.js app â€” great for lightweight API needs.
* **Node.js/Express routes** offer **full control and flexibility**, better for large backend services but require more setup.
