### Context

The app was a large blog/news platform with thousands of articles that update regularly but not every minute.

### What I did:

1. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):**

   * Switched from fully SSR to ISR using `getStaticProps` with `revalidate` in Next.js.
   * This meant pages were statically generated at build time and re-generated in the background on-demand (e.g., every 60 seconds).
   * Result: super fast page loads (static pages served via CDN) without losing freshness.

2. **Dynamic Imports for Heavy Components:**

   * Lazy loaded components that were only needed on some pages (like comment sections, interactive charts).
   * Used `next/dynamic` to reduce initial JS bundle size.

3. **Next.js Image Optimization:**

   * Replaced traditional `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` component.
   * Leveraged automatic resizing, lazy loading, and serving optimized modern formats (like WebP).

4. **Removed Unused Dependencies & Tree Shaking:**

   * Audited bundle sizes using the Next.js Bundle Analyzer.
   * Replaced heavy libraries with lighter alternatives.
   * Ensured proper ES module imports to allow tree shaking.

### Impact:

* **First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI) improved by 40-60%.**
* Dramatic reduction in JavaScript bundle size (sometimes by 50% on key pages).
* Reduced server load and costs due to fewer SSR calls.
* Improved SEO due to faster loading static pages.

### Bonus: Tips for your own app

* Use ISR for pages with content that doesnâ€™t change every request.
* Analyze your bundles regularly.
* Use dynamic imports and image optimization liberally.
* Cache API calls when possible.
