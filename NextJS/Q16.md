### 1. **Code Splitting**

Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code by **page**. This means:

* Each page only loads the JavaScript needed for that page.
* Shared code is extracted into common bundles.
* Result: faster initial load and better caching.

You don’t have to configure anything manually for this basic page-level code splitting; it’s baked into the framework.

### 2. **Lazy Loading Components**

Beyond page-level splitting, Next.js lets you **lazy load React components** so they load only when needed.

You can do this using the dynamic import helper:

```js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

// Lazy load a component (client-side only)
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'));

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Page</h1>
      <HeavyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### Features of `dynamic()`:

* Loads the component only when rendered.
* Supports SSR by default but can be disabled with `{ ssr: false }`.
* Can show a loading fallback while loading:

```js
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
  ssr: false, // disable server-side rendering if needed
});
```

### 3. **Lazy Loading Images**

Next.js also provides an `<Image>` component with built-in lazy loading for images:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function Page() {
  return <Image src="/photo.jpg" alt="Photo" width={600} height={400} />;
}
```

The image is lazy-loaded by default — only loaded when it enters the viewport.

| Feature                 | How Next.js Supports It                      | Benefits                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Code Splitting          | Automatic by page                            | Smaller JS bundles per page          |
| Lazy Loading Components | `dynamic()` import for React components      | Load heavy parts only when needed    |
