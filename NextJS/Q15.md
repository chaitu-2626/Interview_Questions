### What is Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR)?

PPR allows you to **pre-render parts of a page ahead of time (at build time)** and **render other parts dynamically on each request** — giving you the best of both worlds: fast initial load + up-to-date dynamic data.

---

### How does PPR work in the **Next.js App Router**?

1. **Static Segments**
   Some route segments or components are **static** and can be rendered at build time. These are pre-rendered into HTML files.

2. **Dynamic Segments**
   Other parts depend on **dynamic data or user-specific info**, so those are rendered **on the server at request time**.

3. **Streaming / Incremental Rendering**
   Next.js streams the page to the client as pieces become ready. Static parts load immediately, and dynamic parts “fill in” progressively.

### Why use PPR?

* Faster **Time to First Byte (TTFB)** for static content.
* Still get **fresh/dynamic content** where needed.
* Better **SEO** and user experience.

### Example in Next.js App Router

Suppose you have a dashboard:

* User profile (dynamic, depends on logged-in user)
* Site-wide navigation menu (static)
* Recent news feed (can be static, updates hourly)

In your folder structure with React Server Components (RSC), you might:

* Pre-render the nav and news feed at build time.
* Fetch user profile data on every request (SSR).

The framework stitches these parts together and streams the combined HTML to the browser.

---

### How to opt into PPR?

* Use `export const revalidate = 0` (for SSR) or a positive number (for ISR) in your page/component.
* Separate static parts from dynamic parts in your React component tree.
* Use async data fetching functions (`fetch`, `getServerSideProps` alternative) properly.

| Aspect        | Static Generation           | SSR                      | Partial Pre-Rendering                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| When rendered | Build time                  | Each request             | Partly at build time, partly at request time |
| Speed         | Very fast                   | Slower                   | Fast initial + dynamic parts                 |
| Use case      | Content that rarely changes | Frequently changing data | Mixed content                                |
