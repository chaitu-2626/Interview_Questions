### üìå **Page Router vs App Router in Next.js**

| Feature                  | Page Router (`pages/` folder)                             | App Router (`app/` folder) (Next.js 13+)                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing Method**       | File-based routing based on files in `pages/`             | File-based routing with React Server Components in `app/`                   |
| **Rendering Style**      | Uses React components, mostly client components           | Uses React Server Components (RSC) by default                               |
| **Data Fetching**        | `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, `getInitialProps` | Async Server Components and new data fetching patterns                      |
| **Layout Support**       | Manual layout wrapping with `_app.js` or HOCs             | Nested layouts with `layout.js` files, scoped per route                     |
| **Loading States**       | Manual loading UI management                              | Built-in loading.js support for automatic loading states                    |
| **Streaming & Suspense** | No built-in streaming support                             | Supports React 18 streaming and Suspense out of the box                     |
| **API Routes**           | API routes in `pages/api/` folder                         | API routes still in `pages/api` (App Router does not handle API routes yet) |
| **Flexibility**          | Easier for small apps or migrating existing apps          | Designed for large apps with nested layouts and improved UX                 |
| **File structure**       | Flat structure in `pages/`                                | Nested folders with `page.js`, `layout.js`, `loading.js` for rich control   |

### ‚úÖ **When to use Page Router**

* You have an existing Next.js app using the `pages` folder.
* You prefer traditional data fetching methods.
* You want a simpler file structure.

### ‚úÖ **When to use App Router**

* You want to leverage **React Server Components** for performance.
* You need **nested layouts** and **loading states** without boilerplate.
* You want **streaming SSR** and suspense-based UI.
* Building a **modern, scalable app** with complex routing.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Example**

**Page Router:**

```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}
```

**App Router:**

```jsx
// app/about/page.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}

// app/layout.js (nested layout example)
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### üí° **Pro Tip**

Next.js 15 encourages adoption of the **App Router** for new projects because it aligns with React‚Äôs future (server components, suspense, streaming). But both routers can coexist in one project for incremental migration!
