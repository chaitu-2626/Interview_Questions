### 📌 **What is Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)?**

**ISR allows you to update static pages after the site is built — *without a full rebuild or redeploy***.

> ✅ It combines the speed of **Static Site Generation (SSG)** with the freshness of **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**.

---

### ✅ **When to Use ISR**

Use ISR when:

* You want **blazing fast page load** with **static HTML**.
* But your data changes **occasionally** (e.g. product catalog, blog posts, pricing).
* You don’t want to rebuild the whole app on every content change.

---

### 🛠️ **Example: Using ISR in App Router (`app/` folder – Next.js 13+)**

```tsx
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
export const revalidate = 60; // Regenerate this page every 60 seconds

type Props = {
  params: { slug: string };
};

export default async function BlogPost({ params }: Props) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.slug}`);
  const post = await res.json();

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

**What’s happening here:**

* Next.js **generates the page at build time**.
* After the first request, if the page is older than 60 seconds, a **new version is built in the background**.
* Future requests get the updated content — all without a redeploy.

---

### 🧠 How ISR Works Under the Hood

1. User requests a static page (generated at build).
2. If the page is older than the `revalidate` time:

   * Next.js **serves the stale page** instantly.
   * **In the background**, it rebuilds a fresh version.
3. The **next user** gets the fresh version.

### 🔄 ISR vs SSG vs SSR (Quick Comparison)

| Feature   | SSG                  | SSR                     | ISR                              |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Built at  | Build time           | Request time            | Build time + background updates  |
| Freshness | Stale unless rebuilt | Always fresh            | Stale but updated automatically  |
| Speed     | Fastest              | Slower (per request)    | Fast + fresh                     |
| Best for  | Static content       | Real-time dynamic pages | Mostly static, sometimes updated |

### 💡 **Pro Tip**

In App Router (Next.js 13+), you no longer need `getStaticProps()` or `getStaticPaths()` for ISR — **just add `export const revalidate = X`** and use `fetch()` directly in the component. It's cleaner and more powerful.
