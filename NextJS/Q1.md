### üìå **What is Next.js?**

Next.js is a **React-based framework** that adds powerful features like **server-side rendering (SSR)**, **static site generation (SSG)**, **API routes**, **file-based routing**, and more ‚Äî all out of the box.

> ‚úÖ Think of Next.js as a "batteries-included" framework built on top of React.

### ‚úÖ **How is Next.js Different from React?**

| Feature                   | React                        | Next.js                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Rendering                 | Only client-side rendering   | Supports SSR, SSG, ISR, and CSR               |
| Routing                   | Manual (with `react-router`) | File-based routing (`pages/` folder)          |
| API Handling              | Needs backend integration    | Built-in API routes with serverless functions |
| Performance Optimizations | Manual setup                 | Built-in image optimization, code splitting   |
| Fullstack Support         | No                           | Yes (frontend + backend APIs in one project)  |

### üõ†Ô∏è **Example**

**React App (Basic Routing):**

```jsx
// React + React Router
<Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
```

**Next.js App (File-Based Routing):**

```bash
# File: pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}
```
