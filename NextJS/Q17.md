## Tools to Analyze & Optimize Next.js Bundles

### 1. **Next.js Built-in Bundle Analyzer**

Next.js provides an official plugin to visualize bundle size:

* **Package:** [`@next/bundle-analyzer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/bundle-analyzer)
* **What it does:** Generates interactive treemaps of your JavaScript bundles, showing which modules take up the most space.

**Setup example:**

```bash
npm install @next/bundle-analyzer
```

```js
// next.config.js
const withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
});

module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({
  // your Next.js config
});
```

Run with analysis:

```bash
ANALYZE=true npm run build
```

Then open the generated report to inspect.

### 2. **Webpack Bundle Analyzer**

* The Next.js bundle analyzer plugin uses `webpack-bundle-analyzer` under the hood.
* You can use this tool standalone for any Webpack project to generate detailed bundle visualizations.

---

### 3. **Source Map Explorer**

* Analyzes your bundle by using source maps to show the size contribution of each file.
* Useful for identifying which libraries or components bloat your bundles.

```bash
npm install source-map-explorer --save-dev
npm run build
npx source-map-explorer .next/static/chunks/main-*.js
```

### 4. **Lighthouse**

* Google Chrome DevTools has **Lighthouse** to audit your web app’s performance.
* Provides insights on JavaScript size impact, unused code, and offers optimization tips.

---

### 5. **Bundlephobia**

* Online tool to check the size of npm packages before adding them.
* Helps avoid adding heavy dependencies unnecessarily.

## Optimization Techniques to Use with These Tools

* **Dynamic imports** (`next/dynamic`) for lazy loading.
* **Code splitting** (automatic per page).
* **Removing unused dependencies.**
* **Tree shaking** — ensure your dependencies support it.
* **Optimize images** with Next.js `<Image>` component.
* **Use smaller alternatives** to heavy libraries.
* **Avoid large polyfills** unless needed.
