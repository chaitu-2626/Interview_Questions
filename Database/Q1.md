### ✅ What is Normalization in a Database?

**Normalization** is a process used in database design to **organize data efficiently** by removing **redundancy** (duplicate data) and ensuring **data integrity**.

---

### 🔍 Why Normalize?

1. **Avoid Data Redundancy:** Don't store the same data in multiple places.
2. **Improve Data Integrity:** When data changes, update it in only one place.
3. **Optimize Queries:** Well-structured data is easier and faster to query.

### 📚 Example Before Normalization (Unnormalized Table):

| StudentID | StudentName | Course1 | Course2 |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1         | Alice       | Math    | Physics |
| 2         | Bob         | Math    | NULL    |

Problems:

* **Redundancy**: "Math" appears multiple times.
* **Scalability**: What if a student has 5 courses?
* **Querying**: Hard to search all courses.

### ✅ After Normalization (3NF – Third Normal Form)

**1. Student Table:**

| StudentID | StudentName |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | Alice       |
| 2         | Bob         |

**2. Course Table:**

| CourseID | CourseName |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 101      | Math       |
| 102      | Physics    |

**3. Enrollment Table:**

| StudentID | CourseID |
| --------- | -------- |
| 1         | 101      |
| 1         | 102      |
| 2         | 101      |

This structure:

* Removes repetition.
* Makes adding/removing courses easier.
* Keeps the data clean and flexible.
