### ✅ What is Optimistic Locking?

**Optimistic Locking** is a concurrency control technique used in databases and applications to manage **simultaneous access to data** **without using database locks**.

---

### 🔍 Simple Definition:

> **Optimistic Locking assumes that multiple transactions can complete without affecting each other**, and checks for conflicts **only at the time of update**.

---

### 💡 How It Works (Step-by-Step):

1. A user **reads** a record (with its version or timestamp).
2. The user makes changes **locally**.
3. When saving, the system checks:

   * Has the record been modified by someone else?
   * It compares the **original version** (or timestamp) with the **current one** in the database.
4. If they **match**, update goes through.
5. If they **don’t match**, update is **rejected** — user must retry with fresh data.

### 🧠 Example (With Versioning Column):

#### Step 1: User A reads record:

```text
ProductID: 101  
Stock: 50  
Version: 5
```

#### Step 2: User B reads the same record:

```text
ProductID: 101  
Stock: 50  
Version: 5
```

#### Step 3: User A updates stock to 45:

```sql
UPDATE Products
SET Stock = 45, Version = Version + 1
WHERE ProductID = 101 AND Version = 5;
```

> ✅ Succeeds. Version now becomes 6.

#### Step 4: User B tries to update stock to 40:

```sql
UPDATE Products
SET Stock = 40, Version = Version + 1
WHERE ProductID = 101 AND Version = 5;
```

> ❌ Fails. Version is now 6. Conflict detected.

### 🆚 Difference from **Pessimistic Locking**:

| Feature     | Optimistic Locking                  | Pessimistic Locking                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Assumption  | Conflict is rare                    | Conflict is likely                     |
| Locking     | No locks held during read           | Locks record immediately               |
| Performance | Better for high-concurrency reads   | Can block other users                  |
| Use Case    | Web apps, APIs, distributed systems | Critical transactions, banking systems |

---

### 📌 When to Use Optimistic Locking:

* Many users reading data, few updates (low collision chance).
* Web or stateless applications.
* Long-running transactions where holding a lock is expensive.

---

### 🔑 Summary:

> **Optimistic Locking** allows safe concurrent updates by checking for conflicts **at update time**, using a version or timestamp—**without locking the data** during read.
