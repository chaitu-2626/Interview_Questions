### ✅ What is **Index Cardinality** and Why Does It Matter?

**Index cardinality** refers to the **number of unique values** in a column relative to the total number of rows in a table.

---

### 🔍 Simple Definition:

> **Cardinality** = A measure of **uniqueness** in a column.

* **High cardinality** → Many unique values
* **Low cardinality** → Few distinct values (many duplicates)

---

### 🧠 Examples:

| Column    | Total Rows | Unique Values | Cardinality     |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| `email`   | 1,000,000  | 999,950       | **High**        |
| `gender`  | 1,000,000  | 2 (`M`, `F`)  | **Low**         |
| `zipcode` | 1,000,000  | \~50,000      | **Medium-High** |

---

### 📌 Why Cardinality Matters in Indexing:

#### 🔹 1. **Query Optimization**

* **High-cardinality indexes** are generally **more effective**.
* The query planner can use the index to **narrow down to a small result set**.

> **Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'abc@example.com';
```

✅ Fast if `email` has high cardinality.

---

#### 🔸 2. **Low-Cardinality Indexes Are Often Ignored**

* If many rows have the same value, the database **might skip the index** and do a **full table scan** instead.

> **Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = 'F';
```

❌ If half the table has `'F'`, using the index may not save time.

---

#### 🔹 3. **Index Selectivity (Closely Related)**

* **Selectivity** = Unique values / Total rows
* Higher selectivity → Better index efficiency

> High selectivity → Index helps
> Low selectivity → Index may not be used

### 📊 Summary Table:

| Cardinality | Description                      | Good for Indexing?   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| High        | Many unique values (e.g., email) | ✅ Yes                |
| Medium      | Moderate uniqueness (e.g., city) | ✅ Sometimes          |
| Low         | Few unique values (e.g., gender) | ❌ Often not worth it |

---

### ✅ Practical Use Tip:

> Before indexing a column, **check its cardinality**. Indexes on **low-cardinality** columns may waste space and hurt performance with **little to no benefit**.

---

### 🧠 Bonus: Check Cardinality in SQL

**PostgreSQL:**

```sql
SELECT attname, n_distinct
FROM pg_stats
WHERE tablename = 'your_table';
```

**MySQL:**

```sql
SHOW INDEX FROM your_table;
```
