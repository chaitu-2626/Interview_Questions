### ✅ What are ACID Properties in a Database System?

**ACID** is a set of properties that ensure **reliable, consistent, and safe transactions** in a database system—especially in relational databases.

> **ACID** stands for:

* **A** — Atomicity
* **C** — Consistency
* **I** — Isolation
* **D** — Durability

---

### 🔍 1. **Atomicity** – *"All or Nothing"*

* Ensures that **a transaction is fully completed or not at all.**
* If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

**Example:**

```text
Transfer $100 from Account A to Account B
1. Debit Account A
2. Credit Account B
```

If step 2 fails, step 1 is undone—no partial transfer.

---

### 🧮 2. **Consistency** – *"Valid State"*

* Ensures that the database stays in a **valid state before and after the transaction.**
* All constraints, rules, and relationships must be preserved.

**Example:**
If a rule says account balance can’t be negative, the transaction must respect that.

---

### 🛡️ 3. **Isolation** – *"Transactions Don’t Interfere"*

* Ensures that **concurrent transactions** do **not affect each other’s execution**.
* Intermediate states are hidden from other transactions.

**Example:**
Two users booking the last movie ticket at the same time—only one should succeed, others must see updated data.

---

### 💾 4. **Durability** – *"Changes Persist"*

* Once a transaction is committed, the **changes are permanent—even if the system crashes**.
* Data is safely stored in non-volatile memory (e.g., disk).

**Example:**
If you book a flight and the system crashes right after, your booking is still confirmed.

### 📌 Quick Summary Table:

| Property    | Meaning                                | Real-World Analogy                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Atomicity   | All steps succeed or none              | Sending a text—either it sends or not |
| Consistency | Must follow all rules                  | Bank rules: balance can’t go negative |
| Isolation   | No dirty reads from other transactions | Ordering at the same time at a café   |
| Durability  | Changes stay after commit              | Receipt still valid after power loss  |
