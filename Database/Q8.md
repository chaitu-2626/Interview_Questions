### ✅ Difference Between Clustered and Non-Clustered Index in a Database

Indexes improve query performance, but **Clustered** and **Non-Clustered** indexes work differently in how they **store and access data**.

---

### 🔹 1. **Clustered Index**

* **Defines the physical order** of data in the table.
* The **table data is stored in the index itself**.
* Only **one clustered index** per table (since rows can only be sorted one way).

**📦 Think of it like a phone book:**

* Entries are physically sorted by last name.
* Searching by last name is super fast.

#### 🧠 Example:

```sql
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_emp_id
ON Employees(EmployeeID);
```

> The rows in the table will now be **physically sorted** by `EmployeeID`.

---

### 🔸 2. **Non-Clustered Index**

* **Does not change the physical order** of data in the table.
* It maintains a **separate structure** that stores key + a **pointer** (called a Row Locator or RID) to the actual row.
* You can have **multiple non-clustered indexes** on a table.

**📦 Think of it like a book’s index:**

* The index tells you what page to find a topic on—but the actual data is elsewhere.

#### 🧠 Example:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_emp_name
ON Employees(EmployeeName);
```

> The index helps find rows quickly by `EmployeeName`, but data is stored separately.

### 🧾 Summary Table:

| Feature                 | Clustered Index                     | Non-Clustered Index              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Data Storage            | Index **contains actual data**      | Index has **pointers to data**   |
| Physical Sort Order     | **Sorts table rows**                | **Does not sort table rows**     |
| Number Allowed          | Only **one** per table              | **Multiple** allowed             |
| Speed for Range Queries | Faster                              | Slightly slower                  |
| Size                    | Usually smaller                     | Usually larger                   |
| Use Case                | Primary key, frequently sorted cols | Search/filter on non-key columns |

### 🔍 Tip:

> Most databases (like SQL Server, MySQL InnoDB) **cluster the primary key** by default.

---

### 🎯 Final Summary:

> A **clustered index sorts and stores the data rows** in the table, while a **non-clustered index keeps a separate structure** with pointers to the data rows.
