### ✅ How to Offload Work from a Database (DB Performance Optimization)

When your **database is under high load** (slow queries, high CPU, locking issues), it's important to **offload work** to reduce pressure and **improve performance and scalability**.

Here are the **best and practical ways** to offload work from your database:

---

### 🔹 1. **Use Caching (Reduce Repeated Queries)**

* Store frequently accessed data in a **cache layer** like:

  * 🔸 **Redis**
  * 🔸 **Memcached**

**Example:**

* Cache product details or user session data to avoid repeated DB hits.

```bash
App → Redis (hit) ✅ → return  
App → Redis (miss) ❌ → DB → Redis → return
```

---

### 🔹 2. **Read Replicas (Read/Write Splitting)**

* Offload **read-only queries** to **read replicas** (cloned DBs).
* Master handles writes; replicas handle reads.

**Use Case:**

* Analytics, reporting, dashboards

🟢 Supported by: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora, etc.

---

### 🔹 3. **Background Jobs / Queues (Async Processing)**

* Use tools like **RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**, or **Sidekiq** to process heavy tasks **outside the request cycle**.

**Example:**

* Don’t write logs or send emails directly in the transaction—queue them instead.

---

### 🔹 4. **Materialized Views / Precomputed Tables**

* Store **pre-aggregated or computed data** for fast reads.
* Useful for dashboards, analytics, summary reports.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_sales_summary AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(sales) FROM sales GROUP BY product_id;
```

---

### 🔹 5. **Database Partitioning**

* Split large tables into smaller, manageable pieces based on **range or hash** (e.g., by date, region).
* Improves query performance and maintenance.

---

### 🔹 6. **NoSQL for Specific Use Cases**

* Offload unstructured, high-volume, or flexible-schema data to NoSQL.

**Examples:**

* Use **MongoDB** for logs
* Use **Elasticsearch** for full-text search
* Use **Redis** for counters or session storage

---

### 🔹 7. **Limit Expensive Operations**

* Avoid:

  * Complex joins on large tables
  * SELECT \* queries
  * Unindexed WHERE conditions

**✅ Use pagination, indexing, selective columns.**

---

### 🔹 8. **Data Archiving**

* Move historical data to **cold storage** or separate archive tables.
* Keeps active tables fast and small.

### 📌 Summary Table:

| Technique          | What It Helps With                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Caching (Redis)    | Reduce repeated DB reads                |
| Read Replicas      | Scale read-heavy workloads              |
| Background Jobs    | Delay or distribute heavy tasks         |
| Materialized Views | Speed up complex aggregations           |
| Partitioning       | Manage very large tables                |
| NoSQL Offloading   | Handle unstructured or high-volume data |
| Archiving Old Data | Reduce size of hot tables               |

### 💡 Final Tip:

> "Think of your database as **a core engine**—only ask it to do **what it does best**, and offload everything else."
