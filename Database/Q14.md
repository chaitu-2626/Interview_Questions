### ✅ How Do You Track Relations in NoSQL Databases?

Unlike relational databases (which use **foreign keys and joins**), NoSQL databases are **schema-less** and don't support joins natively. However, **relationships can still be modeled**—you just manage them **manually** or through the **application layer**.

---

### 🧠 3 Common Ways to Track Relations in NoSQL:

---

### 🔹 1. **Embedded (Nested) Documents**

* Related data is **stored inside the parent document**.
* Great for **one-to-few** or tightly coupled relationships.
* Improves **read performance** (no need for joins).

**Example (MongoDB - one-to-many):**

```json
{
  "order_id": 101,
  "customer": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Alice"
  },
  "items": [
    { "product_id": 201, "quantity": 2 },
    { "product_id": 202, "quantity": 1 }
  ]
}
```

✅ **Pros:** Fast read, fewer queries
❌ **Cons:** Duplicated data if reused across documents

---

### 🔸 2. **References (Manual Foreign Keys)**

* Store the **ID of the related document**, not the document itself.
* Application must **fetch related data manually**.

**Example (MongoDB - referencing):**

```json
// Orders collection
{
  "order_id": 101,
  "customer_id": 1,
  "item_ids": [201, 202]
}

// Customers collection
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice"
}
```

> You’ll need multiple queries to fetch related data.

✅ **Pros:** Normalized data, smaller documents
❌ **Cons:** More queries, no join support

---

### 🔹 3. **Hybrid (Embed Some, Reference Others)**

* Combine both: **Embed frequently-used data**, and **reference data that changes often or is reused**.

**Example:**

* Embed product name and price in the order (for historical accuracy),
* Reference full product info by ID if needed.

### 📊 Choosing the Right Method:

| Relationship Type   | Best Approach         |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| One-to-One          | Embed or Reference    |
| One-to-Many (Small) | Embed                 |
| One-to-Many (Large) | Reference             |
| Many-to-Many        | Reference with lookup |

---

### 🧠 In Summary:

> In NoSQL, **you track relationships using document embedding or referencing**—the database doesn’t enforce relationships, so it’s up to the **application logic** to manage them.

---

### 💬 Bonus Tip:

> Think of NoSQL as **data-denormalized by design**. It favors **query speed and flexibility** over strict relationships.
