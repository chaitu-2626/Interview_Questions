### ✅ What is Denormalization in a Database?

**Denormalization** is the process of **intentionally adding redundancy** to a normalized database to **improve read performance**.

---

### 🔍 Simple Definition:

> **Denormalization** combines tables or adds duplicate data to **reduce joins** and **speed up queries**, especially in read-heavy systems.

---

### 🎯 Why Use Denormalization?

* To **optimize query speed**.
* To **avoid expensive JOIN operations**.
* To support **reporting, dashboards, or data warehousing**.
* Useful in **OLAP (analytical)** systems more than OLTP (transactional) systems.

### 📚 Example:

#### 🔹 Normalized Design:

| **Orders** |            | **Customers** |            |       |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| OrderID    | CustomerID |               | CustomerID | Name  |
| 101        | 1          |               | 1          | Alice |

To get the customer name for an order:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.Name
FROM Orders
JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

---

#### 🔸 Denormalized Design:

| **Orders** |            |              |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| OrderID    | CustomerID | CustomerName |
| 101        | 1          | Alice        |

Now the query is:

```sql
SELECT OrderID, CustomerName FROM Orders;
```

✅ No JOIN needed → faster for reporting.

### 📈 Benefits of Denormalization:

| ✅ Pros                         | ❌ Cons                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Faster read performance        | Data redundancy                                |
| Fewer joins in complex queries | Risk of inconsistent data (harder to maintain) |
| Simpler query logic            | More storage used                              |
| Better for reporting           | Slower writes and updates                      |

### 🧠 Real-World Use Cases:

* Data Warehouses (Star Schema, Snowflake Schema)
* Reporting/BI Tools
* Static lookup tables
* Caching pre-joined data in NoSQL systems

### 📝 Summary:

> **Denormalization** is the process of **sacrificing storage and consistency** for **speed and performance** in read-heavy applications by **reintroducing redundancy**.
