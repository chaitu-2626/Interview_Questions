### ✅ What is **Optimistic Locking** and **Pessimistic Locking**?

Both are **concurrency control** strategies used to manage **simultaneous access** to the same data in a multi-user environment — preventing **conflicts, dirty reads, lost updates**, etc.

---

### 🔹 1. **Pessimistic Locking**

> Assumes **conflicts are likely**, so it **locks the data** as soon as it's read.

* When a user reads data, a **lock is placed** to prevent others from modifying it until the transaction completes.
* Think: “**Don’t touch it — I’m working on it!**”

#### ✅ Use Case:

* Banking
* Inventory systems
* Financial transactions
* When **data integrity is critical** and **conflicts are frequent**

#### 🔧 Example (SQL):

```sql
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 101 FOR UPDATE;
```

* This locks the row so no one else can update it until your transaction commits.

---

### 🔸 2. **Optimistic Locking**

> Assumes **conflicts are rare**, so it allows multiple users to **read and work on the same data**.
> Conflicts are detected **at the time of update**.

* No lock is placed when reading.

* When updating, it checks whether **someone else changed the data in the meantime** using a **version number** or **timestamp**.

* If the data has changed → the update **fails**, and the transaction must be retried.

#### ✅ Use Case:

* Web applications
* Product catalogs
* Situations where **conflicts are infrequent**
* More scalable and non-blocking

#### 🔧 Example:

Imagine a `users` table with a `version` column.

1. **Read:**

```sql
SELECT id, name, version FROM users WHERE id = 5;
-- Returns version = 3
```

2. **Update (if version hasn’t changed):**

```sql
UPDATE users
SET name = 'Alice Smith', version = 4
WHERE id = 5 AND version = 3;
```

* If the version has changed (someone else updated), the update **will affect 0 rows**, and your app knows there's a **conflict**.

| Feature            | **Pessimistic Locking**               | **Optimistic Locking**         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Locking Type       | Locks rows immediately                | No locks until update          |
| Conflict Detection | Prevented by locking                  | Checked during update          |
| Performance Impact | Slower (more blocking, contention)    | Faster (more scalable)         |
| Deadlock Risk      | ✅ Possible                            | ❌ Avoided                      |
| Use When           | High conflict risk                    | Low conflict, high concurrency |
| Best In            | Critical data systems (e.g., banking) | Web/mobile apps, APIs          |

### 🧠 Final Summary:

> * **Pessimistic Locking** = “Don’t let anyone touch this until I’m done”
> * **Optimistic Locking** = “I’ll work freely, but check for changes before saving”
