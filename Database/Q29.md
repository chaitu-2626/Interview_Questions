### ❌ Disadvantages of Using a **Hash Index**

**Hash indexes** can be very fast for **exact-match lookups**, but they come with some important **limitations** and trade-offs. Below is a concise breakdown you can use for interviews or notes.

### 📌 What is a Hash Index (Quick Recap)?

A **hash index** uses a **hash function** to map key values to a location (bucket). It's great for queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123;
```

### 🚫 Disadvantages of Hash Indexes

| ❗ Limitation                           | 🔍 Description                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. No Range Queries**                | Can't handle `BETWEEN`, `<`, `>`, or `ORDER BY`.                                   |
| **2. No Sorting Support**              | Hash indexes don't store values in sorted order.                                   |
| **3. Collisions Can Hurt Performance** | When multiple values hash to the same bucket, collisions slow lookups.             |
| **4. No Partial Matching**             | Can't use prefix matches like `LIKE 'abc%'`.                                       |
| **5. Not Good for Joins**              | Can't be used effectively in joins that require ordering or range access.          |
| **6. Portability and Support**         | Not all databases fully support hash indexes (e.g., InnoDB in MySQL ignores them). |
| **7. Increased Memory Usage**          | Hash tables often consume more memory than B-Trees due to bucket overhead.         |
| **8. Poor Performance on Duplicates**  | Many duplicate values in a hash index can lead to bloated or slow buckets.         |
| **9. Not Cache Friendly**              | Hash index lookups may cause more CPU cache misses compared to B-Trees.            |

### 🆚 Compared to B-Tree Index:

| Feature       | **Hash Index**       | **B-Tree Index** |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Exact Match   | ✅ Fast               | ✅ Fast           |
| Range Queries | ❌ Not supported      | ✅ Supported      |
| Sorting       | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes            |
| Prefix Match  | ❌ No (`LIKE 'abc%'`) | ✅ Yes            |
| General Use   | ❌ Limited            | ✅ Versatile      |

### 🧠 When to Avoid Hash Indexes:

* Queries involve ranges (`>`, `<`, `BETWEEN`)
* You need `ORDER BY` or `GROUP BY`
* Low-cardinality columns (e.g., gender)
* Queries involve sorting or partial matches

---

### ✅ When Hash Index Can Be Useful:

* **Exact-match lookups only**
* **High-cardinality columns** (e.g., `session_id`, `UUID`)
* Systems with in-memory storage (e.g., Redis)

---

### 📌 Final Summary:

> **Hash indexes are like rocket ships for exact lookups — but terrible at anything else.**
> Use them only when you **know your query pattern is always exact match**, and avoid them if you need **range, sorting, or joins**.
