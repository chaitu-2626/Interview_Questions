### 📊 Comparison Table

| Feature / Index Type       | **B-Tree**                    | **Hash Index**              | **R-Tree**                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Use Case**               | General-purpose queries       | Exact-match lookups         | Multi-dimensional, spatial data         |
| **Supports Range Queries** | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes (for spatial ranges)              |
| **Supports Sorting**       | ✅ Yes (ORDER BY, GROUP BY)    | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes (spatial ordering)                |
| **Data Types**             | Numbers, text, dates          | Exact keys (e.g., user IDs) | Coordinates, geometries, GIS            |
| **Index Structure**        | Balanced search tree (binary) | Hash table (key-value)      | Tree of bounding boxes                  |
| **Query Speed**            | O(log n)                      | O(1) for lookup             | Depends on geometry, usually O(log n)   |
| **Partial Matches**        | ✅ (e.g., LIKE 'abc%')         | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes (in spatial overlap)              |
| **Used In**                | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle     | PostgreSQL (hash), Redis    | PostGIS, spatial DBs (PostgreSQL + GIS) |

### 🔹 1. **B-Tree Index (Balanced Tree)**

* Most **common** index type in relational databases.
* **Sorted** structure, great for **equality and range-based** queries.

**Best For:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY last_name;
```

✅ Good for:

* WHERE =, >, <, BETWEEN
* ORDER BY
* Index scans

---

### 🔸 2. **Hash Index**

* Uses a **hash function** to compute the index key.
* Great for **fast, exact match** lookups.
* Does **not support range queries or sorting**.

**Best For:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE session_id = 'abc123';
```

✅ Pros:

* Super fast for exact matches
  ❌ Cons:
* No range queries, no ordering
* Collisions may degrade performance

> ⚠️ Note: Not all databases support hash indexes by default.

---

### 🔺 3. **R-Tree Index (Rectangle Tree)**

* Used for **spatial and multi-dimensional** data (e.g., GIS, maps).
* Organizes data using **bounding rectangles** (min/max for X/Y coordinates).
* Supports **spatial queries** like “find points inside this box” or “nearest neighbors”.

**Best For:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM locations 
WHERE ST_Within(geom, ST_MakeEnvelope(10, 10, 50, 50));
```

✅ Pros:

* Handles 2D/3D spatial objects (points, polygons)
* Good for range and overlap queries in space

> 📍 Used in **PostGIS**, **SQLite with SpatiaLite**, **Oracle Spatial**

### 🧠 When to Use What:

| Scenario                              | Use This Index   |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Range queries, sorted data            | ✅ **B-Tree**     |
| Fast key-based lookup (cache/session) | ✅ **Hash Index** |
| Geographic data, map coordinates      | ✅ **R-Tree**     |

---

### 🧠 Final Summary:

> * **B-Tree** = General-purpose index (good for most queries)
> * **Hash** = Fast for **exact matches only**
> * **R-Tree** = Spatial data like maps, geometry, bounding boxes
